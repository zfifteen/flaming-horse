    "intro": """Welcome to our step-by-step guide on polynomial long division. You might think calculators handle all polynomial divisions, but understanding the process builds algebraic intuition and helps with factoring or partial fractions. We'll divide the cubic polynomial x cubed plus 3 x squared plus x minus 3 by the linear divisor x plus 1. Here, the dividend is the larger polynomial on top, and the divisor is x plus 1 below it. Let's dive in!""",
    "setup": """For our example, the dividend is x³ + 3x² + x - 3, and the divisor is x + 1. We'll set up the division like long division: draw the bracket, place the dividend inside, and the divisor outside. Now watch as we prepare for the first step.""",
    "step1": """First, divide the leading term of the dividend, x cubed, by the leading term of the divisor, x, giving us x squared as the first quotient term. Write that above the bracket. Now multiply x squared by the entire divisor: x squared times x plus 1 is x cubed plus x squared. Subtract this from the dividend: (x³ + 3x² + x - 3) minus (x³ + x²) gives us 2x² + x - 3. Great first partial remainder!""",
    "step2": """Bring down the next term—well, we've already got 2x² + x - 3. Divide the leading 2x squared by x, getting 2x as the next quotient term. Multiply 2x by x + 1: 2x squared plus 2x. Subtract: (2x² + x - 3) minus (2x² + 2x) yields -x - 3. Solid progress!""",
    "step3": """Now divide -x by x, which is -1, the final quotient term. Multiply -1 by x + 1: -x - 1. Subtract from -x - 3: (-x - 3) minus (-x - 1) = -2. So the quotient is x² + 2x - 1, with remainder -2. Verify by multiplying back: (x + 1)(x² + 2x - 1) + (-2) should equal the original dividend. It checks out!""",
    "recap": """To recap polynomial long division: divide leading terms, multiply across, subtract, bring down, repeat until done. Common pitfalls: forgetting to bring down terms or sign errors in subtraction. Practice with simpler examples first. Now you can tackle polynomial division confidently—try it yourself next time! Thanks for watching."""
