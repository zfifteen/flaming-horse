    "phase_flip": """The Chandler wobble's 180-degree phase reversal upon reappearance in 2021 is not merely a symptom of excitation collapse — it is a direct signature that the Earth's core-mantle system crossed a coupling-regime boundary, and the specific phase inversion predicts that the 6-year length-of-day oscillation will also exhibit a half-cycle phase shift detectable by 2027.""",
    
    "debunk_standard": """The standard explanation treats the Chandler wobble disappearance as a statistical fluke where random atmospheric and oceanic forcing happened to cancel out. But random cancellation cannot produce a clean 180-degree phase flip upon reappearance — randomness would produce a random new phase.""",
    
    "modulated_envelope": """A precise half-cycle inversion is the hallmark of a system that passed through a node in a modulated envelope, meaning something with a longer period is amplitude-modulating the Chandler wobble. That modulator must share a coupling pathway with the core.""",
    
    "lod_connection": """The 6-year LOD oscillation, driven by torsional Alfven waves at the core-mantle boundary, already showed an anomalous "interruption" during 2010-2014. If the same coupling-regime shift that killed and phase-inverted the Chandler wobble also perturbed the 6-year signal, the two disruptions should be temporally offset by the difference in their resonant response times — roughly 5 to 7 years.""",
    
    "prediction": """This means the 6-year LOD oscillation, when it fully re-establishes after the 2010-2014 interruption, should show its own phase offset relative to pre-2010 behavior. Not necessarily a full 180-degree flip, but a measurable shift in the phase relationship between LOD and atmospheric angular momentum.""",
    
    "paradigm_shift": """The non-obvious implication is that Chandler wobble phase reversals are not 90-year random events — they are leading indicators of core-mantle coupling regime transitions, arriving years before the same transition propagates into the LOD signal and subsequently into climate-relevant angular momentum transfer.""",
    
    "utility": """If correct, monitoring Chandler wobble phase stability becomes a predictive tool for anticipating disruptions in the 6-year climate-linked oscillation, with a lead time of approximately half a decade.""",
