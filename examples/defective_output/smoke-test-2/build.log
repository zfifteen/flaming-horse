Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, he told me, just remember that all the people in the world haven't had the advantages that you've had. He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way. And I understand that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments. A habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran boars. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person. And so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician because I was privy to secrets of the wild unknown men. Most of the conferences were unsought. Frequently I have famed sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on a horizon. For the intimate revelations of young men or at least in terms of which they expressed them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Having judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forgot that as my father snobbishly suggested. And I snobbishly repeat, a sense of fundamental decencies is puzzled out on equally a birth. And after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. One duck may be founded on hard rock or wet marshes, but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. I came back to the east last autumn. I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and a sort of moral attention forever. I wanted no more righteous excursions with privileged climpses into a human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction. That's me, who represented everything for which I have unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, there was something gorgeous about him, some unhightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if they were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes 10,000 miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with what Flabby and Prussian ability, which was dignified under the name of creative temperament. It was an extraordinary gift of hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person in which is not likely I shall ever find again. No, Gatsby turned out all right at the end. It is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and show short-winded relations of men. My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city of three generations. The caroways are something of a clan, and we have tradition that were descended from the Duke's suburluck. But the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother, who came here in 51, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started a wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today. And so with the sunshine and the great burst of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had a familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health that would pull down out of the young breath, giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf and read and gold like new money from the mint, promising unfold shining secrets that only might us in Morgan and Messianess knew. I had an eye-had high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college, one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale news. And now I was going back to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the well-rounded man. This is in just an epigram. Life is more successfully looked at from a single window after all. It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. I was on that slender, righteous island which extends itself to east of New York and where there are among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, just out into the most domesticated body of water in a western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals, like the egg and Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end, but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the goals that fly overhead. To the wingless, a more arresting phenomenon is their dismissalarity in the every peculiar except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, the well, the less fashionable of the two. This was the most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between men. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only 50 yards from the sound and squeeze between two huge places that rented for 12 and 15,000 a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard. It was a factual limitation of the hotel, the vill, and Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking you under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than 40 acres of lawn and garden. Those gatsby's mention, or rather, as I did a no Mr. Gatby, it was a mention inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an I-sore, but it was a small I-sore, and it had been overlooked. So I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires, all for $80 a month. Across the bay, the white palaces, a fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins in the evening. I drove over there to have dinner with Tom Buchanan's. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I known Tom and College. At last, after the war, I spent two days with him in Chicago. Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that played football at New Haven, a national figure in a way, one whose men, who reached such acute, limited excellence at 21, that everything afterwards savers and anti-climax, his family were enormously wealthy, even in the commonwealth, his freedom with money was a matter of reproach, but now he'd left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away. For instance, he brought down a string of polo ponies from the lake forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my generation was wealthy enough to do that. When they came east, I didn't know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played solo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy of the telephone, but I didn't believe it. I had no sight in the Daisy's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence or sometimes irrecoverable football game. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that happened at my local library last week. So like, I'm there looking for this obscure book about urban legends, right? And I stumble into this hidden reading room I never knew existed. I mean, it's filled with these ancient looking maps and weird artifacts, but here's a thing. It turns out this secret club for people who investigated unexplained mysteries in the city. They've been meeting there for decades documenting everything from mysterious sounds in the subway tunnels to unexplained lights in the park. I mean, these people were totally serious about it too. They've got spreadsheets, surveillance equipment, the whole deal. And the library and who showed me around, she's been running this thing since the 80s. But yeah, I know, I'm kind of hooked. Like, spent three hours last night cataloging reports and spontaneous music coming from empty buildings. Yeah. So my neighbor Tom, you know, the quiet guy who works on accounting, turns out he's got this absolutely insane hobby. Get this. He's been building a miniature replica of the entire city in his basement. But I mean, not just any replica. This thing is work streetlights, tiny cars that actually move around tracks. This thing is incredibly detailed business buildings with tiny people living their tiny lives inside. And like, he's programmed this whole system to mirror real time traffic patterns from Google Maps. His whole setup takes up his entire basement. He's been working on it for seven years. He's estimated it'll take 12 to complete. The dedication is honestly kind of inspiring. His wife just rolls her eyes wherever he anyone brings it up. So here's the thing about this new cafe that opened up downtown. It looks absolutely normal from the outside. But once you step in, everything gets weird in the best possible way. They've got this menu that change based on your mood. Like you walk in feeling stressed and suddenly the special of the day is this crazy blue tea that supposedly helps with anxiety. The barista, this fascinating woman with silver hair in about a thousand stories, she says they use some kind of advanced AI to read micro expressions. But I mean, sometimes she seems to know what you need before you even walk through the door. The regulars all have stories about her. I think she's a time traveler. Others say she's just really good at reading people. The coffee's amazing either way. Hey there fellow gamers. Ready to up your Fortnite game? Let's dive into these advanced building techniques.

Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that happened at my local library last week. So like, I'm there looking for this obscure book about urban legends, right?

The barista, this fascinating woman with silver hair and about a thousand stories, she says they use some kind of advanced AI to read micro expressions. But I mean, sometimes she seems to know what you need before you even walk through the door. The regulars all have theories about her. Something she's a time traveler, others say she's just really good at reading people. The coffee's amazing either way. You know what's been absolutely messing with my head lately, the situation at work. And like it started with something so simple, just a plan on my desk. This little succulent, nothing special. But then people started leaving notes next to it, confessing these really deep secrets. It became this weird anonymous, confessional spot. But I mean, some of these secrets are wild. Someone admitted to having a second family in Canada, another person revealed that they've been secretly learning circus arts for five years. The whole thing snowballed. And now there's this entire mythology around this plant. People leave offerings, cookies, small trinkets, weird origami. Management tried to remove it once, but that was nearly a revolt. Now they just pretend it doesn't exist. And yeah, speaking of weird work stuff, my friend Sarah just started this new job at what she thought was a normal tech company. But I mean, nothing about this place is normal. The CEO insists on conducting all meetings while walking backwards. Something about reverse engineering problems. They've got this thing where every Thursday, everyone has to speak in rhymes. The coffee machine only works if you tell it a joke. But here's a crazy part. They're incredibly successful. Like industry leading successful. Makes you wonder if we're all doing it wrong with our normal, forward walking meetings and joke free coffee machines. Let me tell you about this absolute chaos that unfolded at my cousin's wedding last month. So like everything was going perfectly normal until the best man's speech. He starts talking complete routine stuff. Then suddenly this elderly woman stands up and announces that she's actually the groom's long lost aunt, who's presumed dead in a skiing accident 20 years ago. But I mean, she wasn't even invited. Just walked in off the street. The whole room went silent. And like she turns out, she's not even related to anyone there. She just goes around to random weddings doing this. Apparently she's some kind of local legend. Some people even try to spot her at weddings now. Like some kind of wedding crash or bingo. I've been taking these pottery classes recently and honestly, the whole experience has been surreal. The instructor, this absolutely fascinating guy who used to be a quantum physicist, he teaches everything through physics metaphors. But I mean, it actually works. He'll start talking about particle behavior and suddenly your bowl isn't collapsing anymore. And like the class has attracted this weird mix of people. There's a former circus clown who makes these incredibly detailed miniature carousels a detective who only works on cold cases and this mysterious person who shows up completely covered and glitter every single time. Nobody knows their story. And at this point, everyone's too afraid to ask. Yeah, so my sister's been working on this really interesting research project at the university. She's been studying how different types of music affect plant growth. But it's gotten completely out of hand. And like she's got this greenhouse full of plants listening to everything from death metal to classical opera. I mean, the results are wild. The plants listen to heavy metal are growing. These incredibly thick, sturdy stems while the ones listening to jazz are growing in this weird improvisational patterns. The classical music section looks like something out of a Victorian garden party. The university's bottomary department doesn't know what to make of it. But the music department has started holding concerts in the greenhouse. So here's the thing about this new restaurant that opened up in my neighborhood. They've taken the concept of diner theater to a whole new level. The entire staff are actually undercover actors participating in an ongoing mystery story that changes every night. But I mean, they never take a break. They never break character. Even when things go completely sideways. Last time I was there, what started out as a simple diner turned into that is a elaborate plot involving international espionage, a missing recipe, and a pet parrot who knew too much. And like you never know if the person sitting next to you is another customer or part of the story. The food is actually amazing too, which seems almost secondary to the whole experience. The health inspector visits last month accidentally became part of the storyline about a time traveling food critic from the year 2150. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that's happening in my apartment building. Somebody started an anonymous wrote note writing chain that turned into this build building wide storytelling experiment. And like it started with just one note in the elevator asking people to share their most interesting dream. But here's a thing. Now the entire building is turned into this collaborative writing project. The laundry room has become a romance chapter. The lobby is for plot twists and the mail room is strictly for character development. But I mean, nobody knows who started it and somehow that makes it even better. The building manager tried to stop it until she got completely hooked on the storyline developing in the recycling area. Yeah, so my cousin started this underground appreciation society for really specific things. Like not just books or movies but super niche stuff. And like they meet in different places every month to collaborate these incredibly specific topics. I mean last month was dedicated to the sound of tennis shoes, the sound that tennis shoes make on freshly waxed floors. Before that they spent an entire evening discussing and recreating that specific smell of photocopy paper. The meetings are getting bigger every month. They had to rent out an entire warehouse for the celebration on the particular way some light looks when it comes through half closed blinds on a dusty afternoon. The whole thing is ridiculously specific but somehow deeply relatable. So here's a thing about this new app my friend developed. It's designed to connect people based on their most embarrassing moments. But I mean, it's actually becoming really popular. Instead of showing your best self, instead of showing your best self, you have to lead with your most awkward stories. And like people are forming these incredible friendships over shared experiences of walking in the glass doors or calling their teacher mom and high school. The more cringe-worthy the story, the more connections you make. And they're even organizing meetups now where everyone has to recreate their embarrassing moment as an icebreaker. Somehow it's the most honest social network I've ever seen. At this point, but whatever just friendship and the digital age pretending you're going to consume hours of content just to be polite. You want to hear something kind of ridiculous? My recent attempt at meal prepping. So anyway, but all these fancy containers color-coded everything. I mean, yeah, I spent an entire Sunday cooking just feeling like I had my life together for once. But by Wednesday, order take out again. All these perfectly plan meals just sitting there judging from my fridge. And like now I've got this container collection that's basically expensive topware for leftovers all probably forget about. The whole situation with trying to be environmentally conscious, getting pretty complicated. I mean, just standing in the grocery store, having an existential crisis over which type of milk is actually better for the planet. So like regular milk, bad for the environment. All men milk apparently uses too much water. Oh milk, I don't know, probably has its own issues. But yeah, just paralyzed in the dairy aisle, contemplating the environmental impact of breakfast choices. The thing with social media memories popping up kind of a psychological roller coaster. Like just going about your day and suddenly your phone shows you something from five years ago. I mean, yeah, photos, you don't even remember taking posts that make you cringe, just your past self and bushing your present self. And so I guess that's what we have to do with now. Random reminders of our questionable fashion choices and old relationships. But whatever, at least it's entertaining in a sort of mortifying way. The whole DIY furniture trend is taking an interesting turn in my life. I mean, yeah, bought this desk online. One of those easy assembly things. But like three hours in, just sitting there surrounded by random pieces. Instructions that make it, might as well be ancient hieroglyphics. And so I know that's how my living room became this weird furniture of a graveyard, just parts everywhere. The funny thing started using this box that came in as a temporary desk. But whatever, maybe that's just a real DIY finding creative ways to avoid actual assembly. Hey, there fellow gamers ready to up your fortnight game. Let's dive into those advanced building techniques. Start by honing your skills in creative mode to master different structures.

It is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and show short-winded relations of men. My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city of three generations. The caroways are something of a clan, and we have tradition that were descended from the Duke's suburluck. But the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother, who came here in 51, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started a wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today. And so with the sunshine and the great burst of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had a familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health that would pull down out of the young breath, giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf and read and gold like new money from the mint, promising unfold shining secrets that only might us in Morgan and Messianess knew. I had an eye-had high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college, one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale news. And now I was going back to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the well-rounded man. This is in just an epigram. Life is more successfully looked at from a single window after all. It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. I was on that slender, righteous island which extends itself to east of New York and where there are among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, just out into the most domesticated body of water in a western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals, like the egg and Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end, but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the goals that fly overhead. To the wingless, a more arresting phenomenon is their dismissalarity in the every peculiar except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, the well, the less fashionable of the two. This was the most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between men. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only 50 yards from the sound and squeeze between two huge places that rented for 12 and 15,000 a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard. It was a factual limitation of the hotel, the vill, and Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking you under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than 40 acres of lawn and garden. Those gatsby's mention, or rather, as I did a no Mr. Gatby, it was a mention inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an I-sore, but it was a small I-sore, and it had been overlooked. So I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires, all for $80 a month. Across the bay, the white palaces, a fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins in the evening. I drove over there to have dinner with Tom Buchanan's. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I known Tom and College. At last, after the war, I spent two days with him in Chicago. Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that played football at New Haven, a national figure in a way, one whose men, who reached such acute, limited excellence at 21, that everything afterwards savers and anti-climax, his family were enormously wealthy, even in the commonwealth, his freedom with money was a matter of reproach, but now he'd left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away. For instance, he brought down a string of polo ponies from the lake forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my generation was wealthy enough to do that. When they came east, I didn't know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played solo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy of the telephone, but I didn't believe it. I had no sight in the Daisy's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence or sometimes irrecoverable football game. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that happened at my local library last week. So like, I'm there looking for this obscure book about urban legends, right? And I stumble into this hidden reading room I never knew existed. I mean, it's filled with these ancient looking maps and weird artifacts, but here's a thing. It turns out this secret club for people who investigated unexplained mysteries in the city. They've been meeting there for decades documenting everything from mysterious sounds in the subway tunnels to unexplained lights in the park. I mean, these people were totally serious about it too. They've got spreadsheets, surveillance equipment, the whole deal. And the library and who showed me around, she's been running this thing since the 80s. But yeah, I know, I'm kind of hooked. Like, spent three hours last night cataloging reports and spontaneous music coming from empty buildings. Yeah. So my neighbor Tom, you know, the quiet guy who works on accounting, turns out he's got this absolutely insane hobby. Get this. He's been building a miniature replica of the entire city in his basement. But I mean, not just any replica. This thing is work streetlights, tiny cars that actually move around tracks. This thing is incredibly detailed business buildings with tiny people living their tiny lives inside. And like, he's programmed this whole system to mirror real time traffic patterns from Google Maps. His whole setup takes up his entire basement. He's been working on it for seven years. He's estimated it'll take 12 to complete. The dedication is honestly kind of inspiring. His wife just rolls her eyes wherever he anyone brings it up. So here's the thing about this new cafe that opened up downtown. It looks absolutely normal from the outside. But once you step in, everything gets weird in the best possible way. They've got this menu that change based on your mood. Like you walk in feeling stressed and suddenly the special of the day is this crazy blue tea that supposedly helps with anxiety. The barista, this fascinating woman with silver hair in about a thousand stories, she says they use some kind of advanced AI to read micro expressions. But I mean, sometimes she seems to know what you need before you even walk through the door. The regulars all have stories about her. I think she's a time traveler. Others say she's just really good at reading people. The coffee's amazing either way. Hey there fellow gamers. Ready to up your Fortnite game? Let's dive into these advanced building techniques.

Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that happened at my local library last week. So like, I'm there looking for this obscure book about urban legends, right? And I stumble into this hidden reading room I never knew existed. I mean, it's filled with these ancient looking maps and weird artifacts. But here's a thing. Turns out this secret club for people who investigate unexplained mysteries in the city. They've been meeting there for decades, documenting everything from mysterious sounds and the subway tunnels to unexplain lights over the park. I mean, these people are totally serious about it too. They've got spreadsheets, surveillance equipment, the whole deal. And the library and who showed me around. She's been running this thing since the 80s. But yeah, now I'm kind of hooked.

So my neighbor Tom, you know, the quiet guy who works in accounting, turns out he's got this absolutely insane hobby. Get this. He's been building a miniature replica of the entire city in his basement. But I mean, not just any replica, this thing has working streetlights. Tiny cars that actually move around on tracks and these incredibly detailed business with tiny people living their tiny lives inside. And like he's programmed this whole system to mirror real time traffic patterns from Google Maps. The whole setup takes up his entire basement. He's been working on it for seven years and he estimates it'll take 12 to complete. The dedication is honestly kind of inspiring. His wife just rolls her eyes whenever anyone brings it up. So here's the thing about this new cafe that opened up downtown. It looks totally normal from the outside. But once you step in, everything gets weird in the best possible way. They've got this menu that changes based on your mood. Like you walk in, feeling stressed and suddenly the special of the day is this crazy blue tea that supposedly helps with anxiety. The barista, this fascinating woman with silver hair and about a thousand stories, she says they use some kind of advanced AI to read micro expressions. But I mean, sometimes she seems to know what you need before you even walk through the door. The regulars all have theories about her. Something she's a time traveler, others say she's just really good at reading people. The coffee's amazing either way. You know what's been absolutely messing with my head lately, the situation at work. And like it started with something so simple, just a plan on my desk. This little succulent, nothing special. But then people started leaving notes next to it, confessing these really deep secrets. It became this weird anonymous, confessional spot. But I mean, some of these secrets are wild. Someone admitted to having a second family in Canada, another person revealed that they've been secretly learning circus arts for five years. The whole thing snowballed. And now there's this entire mythology around this plant. People leave offerings, cookies, small trinkets, weird origami. Management tried to remove it once, but that was nearly a revolt. Now they just pretend it doesn't exist. And yeah, speaking of weird work stuff, my friend Sarah just started this new job at what she thought was a normal tech company. But I mean, nothing about this place is normal. The CEO insists on conducting all meetings while walking backwards. Something about reverse engineering problems. They've got this thing where every Thursday, everyone has to speak in rhymes. The coffee machine only works if you tell it a joke. But here's a crazy part. They're incredibly successful. Like industry leading successful. Makes you wonder if we're all doing it wrong with our normal, forward walking meetings and joke free coffee machines. Let me tell you about this absolute chaos that unfolded at my cousin's wedding last month. So like everything was going perfectly normal until the best man's speech. He starts talking complete routine stuff. Then suddenly this elderly woman stands up and announces that she's actually the groom's long lost aunt, who's presumed dead in a skiing accident 20 years ago. But I mean, she wasn't even invited. Just walked in off the street. The whole room went silent. And like she turns out, she's not even related to anyone there. She just goes around to random weddings doing this. Apparently she's some kind of local legend. Some people even try to spot her at weddings now. Like some kind of wedding crash or bingo. I've been taking these pottery classes recently and honestly, the whole experience has been surreal. The instructor, this absolutely fascinating guy who used to be a quantum physicist, he teaches everything through physics metaphors. But I mean, it actually works. He'll start talking about particle behavior and suddenly your bowl isn't collapsing anymore. And like the class has attracted this weird mix of people. There's a former circus clown who makes these incredibly detailed miniature carousels a detective who only works on cold cases and this mysterious person who shows up completely covered and glitter every single time. Nobody knows their story. And at this point, everyone's too afraid to ask. Yeah, so my sister's been working on this really interesting research project at the university. She's been studying how different types of music affect plant growth. But it's gotten completely out of hand. And like she's got this greenhouse full of plants listening to everything from death metal to classical opera. I mean, the results are wild. The plants listen to heavy metal are growing. These incredibly thick, sturdy stems while the ones listening to jazz are growing in this weird improvisational patterns. The classical music section looks like something out of a Victorian garden party. The university's bottomary department doesn't know what to make of it. But the music department has started holding concerts in the greenhouse. So here's the thing about this new restaurant that opened up in my neighborhood. They've taken the concept of diner theater to a whole new level. The entire staff are actually undercover actors participating in an ongoing mystery story that changes every night. But I mean, they never take a break. They never break character. Even when things go completely sideways. Last time I was there, what started out as a simple diner turned into that is a elaborate plot involving international espionage, a missing recipe, and a pet parrot who knew too much. And like you never know if the person sitting next to you is another customer or part of the story. The food is actually amazing too, which seems almost secondary to the whole experience. The health inspector visits last month accidentally became part of the storyline about a time traveling food critic from the year 2150. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that's happening in my apartment building. Somebody started an anonymous wrote note writing chain that turned into this build building wide storytelling experiment. And like it started with just one note in the elevator asking people to share their most interesting dream. But here's a thing. Now the entire building is turned into this collaborative writing project. The laundry room has become a romance chapter. The lobby is for plot twists and the mail room is strictly for character development. But I mean, nobody knows who started it and somehow that makes it even better. The building manager tried to stop it until she got completely hooked on the storyline developing in the recycling area. Yeah, so my cousin started this underground appreciation society for really specific things. Like not just books or movies but super niche stuff. And like they meet in different places every month to collaborate these incredibly specific topics. I mean last month was dedicated to the sound of tennis shoes, the sound that tennis shoes make on freshly waxed floors. Before that they spent an entire evening discussing and recreating that specific smell of photocopy paper. The meetings are getting bigger every month. They had to rent out an entire warehouse for the celebration on the particular way some light looks when it comes through half closed blinds on a dusty afternoon. The whole thing is ridiculously specific but somehow deeply relatable. So here's a thing about this new app my friend developed. It's designed to connect people based on their most embarrassing moments. But I mean, it's actually becoming really popular. Instead of showing your best self, instead of showing your best self, you have to lead with your most awkward stories. And like people are forming these incredible friendships over shared experiences of walking in the glass doors or calling their teacher mom and high school. The more cringe-worthy the story, the more connections you make. And they're even organizing meetups now where everyone has to recreate their embarrassing moment as an icebreaker. Somehow it's the most honest social network I've ever seen. At this point, but whatever just friendship and the digital age pretending you're going to consume hours of content just to be polite. You want to hear something kind of ridiculous? My recent attempt at meal prepping. So anyway, but all these fancy containers color-coded everything. I mean, yeah, I spent an entire Sunday cooking just feeling like I had my life together for once. But by Wednesday, order take out again. All these perfectly plan meals just sitting there judging from my fridge. And like now I've got this container collection that's basically expensive topware for leftovers all probably forget about. The whole situation with trying to be environmentally conscious, getting pretty complicated. I mean, just standing in the grocery store, having an existential crisis over which type of milk is actually better for the planet. So like regular milk, bad for the environment. All men milk apparently uses too much water. Oh milk, I don't know, probably has its own issues. But yeah, just paralyzed in the dairy aisle, contemplating the environmental impact of breakfast choices. The thing with social media memories popping up kind of a psychological roller coaster. Like just going about your day and suddenly your phone shows you something from five years ago. I mean, yeah, photos, you don't even remember taking posts that make you cringe, just your past self and bushing your present self. And so I guess that's what we have to do with now. Random reminders of our questionable fashion choices and old relationships. But whatever, at least it's entertaining in a sort of mortifying way. The whole DIY furniture trend is taking an interesting turn in my life. I mean, yeah, bought this desk online. One of those easy assembly things. But like three hours in, just sitting there surrounded by random pieces. Instructions that make it, might as well be ancient hieroglyphics. And so I know that's how my living room became this weird furniture of a graveyard, just parts everywhere. The funny thing started using this box that came in as a temporary desk. But whatever, maybe that's just a real DIY finding creative ways to avoid actual assembly. Hey, there fellow gamers ready to up your fortnight game. Let's dive into those advanced building techniques. Start by honing your skills in creative mode to master different structures.

Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, he told me, just remember that all the people in the world haven't had the advantages that you've had. He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way. And I understand that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments. A habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran boars. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person. And so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician because I was privy to secrets of the wild unknown men. Most of the conferences were unsought. Frequently I have famed sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on a horizon. For the intimate revelations of young men or at least in terms of which they expressed them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Having judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forgot that as my father snobbishly suggested. And I snobbishly repeat, a sense of fundamental decencies is puzzled out on equally a birth. And after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. One duck may be founded on hard rock or wet marshes, but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. I came back to the east last autumn. I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and a sort of moral attention forever. I wanted no more righteous excursions with privileged climpses into a human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction. That's me, who represented everything for which I have unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, there was something gorgeous about him, some unhightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if they were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes 10,000 miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with what Flabby and Prussian ability, which was dignified under the name of creative temperament. It was an extraordinary gift of hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person in which is not likely I shall ever find again. No, Gatsby turned out all right at the end. It is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and show short-winded relations of men. My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city of three generations. The caroways are something of a clan, and we have tradition that were descended from the Duke's suburluck. But the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother, who came here in 51, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started a wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today. And so with the sunshine and the great burst of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had a familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health that would pull down out of the young breath, giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf and read and gold like new money from the mint, promising unfold shining secrets that only might us in Morgan and Messianess knew. I had an eye-had high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college, one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale news. And now I was going back to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the well-rounded man. This is in just an epigram. Life is more successfully looked at from a single window after all. It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. I was on that slender, righteous island which extends itself to east of New York and where there are among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, just out into the most domesticated body of water in a western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals, like the egg and Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end, but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the goals that fly overhead. To the wingless, a more arresting phenomenon is their dismissalarity in the every peculiar except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, the well, the less fashionable of the two. This was the most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between men. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only 50 yards from the sound and squeeze between two huge places that rented for 12 and 15,000 a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard. It was a factual limitation of the hotel, the vill, and Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking you under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than 40 acres of lawn and garden.

They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played solo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy of the telephone, but I didn't believe it. I had no sight in the Daisy's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence or sometimes irrecoverable football game. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that happened at my local library last week. So like, I'm there looking for this obscure book about urban legends, right? And I stumble into this hidden reading room I never knew existed. I mean, it's filled with these ancient looking maps and weird artifacts, but here's a thing. It turns out this secret club for people who investigated unexplained mysteries in the city. They've been meeting there for decades documenting everything from mysterious sounds in the subway tunnels to unexplained lights in the park. I mean, these people were totally serious about it too. They've got spreadsheets, surveillance equipment, the whole deal. And the library and who showed me around, she's been running this thing since the 80s. But yeah, I know, I'm kind of hooked. Like, spent three hours last night cataloging reports and spontaneous music coming from empty buildings. Yeah. So my neighbor Tom, you know, the quiet guy who works on accounting, turns out he's got this absolutely insane hobby. Get this. He's been building a miniature replica of the entire city in his basement. But I mean, not just any replica. This thing is work streetlights, tiny cars that actually move around tracks. This thing is incredibly detailed business buildings with tiny people living their tiny lives inside. And like, he's programmed this whole system to mirror real time traffic patterns from Google Maps. His whole setup takes up his entire basement. He's been working on it for seven years. He's estimated it'll take 12 to complete. The dedication is honestly kind of inspiring. His wife just rolls her eyes wherever he anyone brings it up. So here's the thing about this new cafe that opened up downtown. It looks absolutely normal from the outside. But once you step in, everything gets weird in the best possible way. They've got this menu that change based on your mood. Like you walk in feeling stressed and suddenly the special of the day is this crazy blue tea that supposedly helps with anxiety. The barista, this fascinating woman with silver hair in about a thousand stories, she says they use some kind of advanced AI to read micro expressions. But I mean, sometimes she seems to know what you need before you even walk through the door. The regulars all have stories about her. I think she's a time traveler.

Brushes, watercolour paper and your favorite blues and purples. We'll also use water and some table salt for a special effect. First, dampen the paper slightly like a summer breeze. Now drop in loose washes of color and let the flow organically. Here's a fun part. While the pain is wet, sprinkle some salt on the washes. Watch the crystals react creating beautiful starry textures. Let the salt work its magic for a minute or two. Then gently dab the crystals away with a clean paper towel. Now add a few little white stars with a light touch. There you have it. Your own mesmerizing watercolor galaxy. Remember, there are no mistakes. Only happy accidents. So experiment, have fun and let your creativity soar. Breakfast champions. This video is for mornings when time is tight. We'll whip up three quick and healthy meals in under five minutes.

Pour in your egg mixture and scramble it like a champ. Season with salt, pepper and maybe some cheese. This is your breakfast masterpiece after all. Next, the power smoothie. Grab your blender. Throw in spinach, frozen berries, Greek yogurt, your favorite milk and a banana for sweetness. Blend it up for a delicious and nutritious morning fuel. Last, the overnight oats sensation. The night before, grab a jar and layer some rolled oats. Your choice of milk and a touch of honey. Add chia seeds or chopped nuts for extra boost. These are just ideas folks. Get creative and personalize your meals to your taste. The key is to be quick and efficient. So there you have it. Three healthy meals and delicious breakfast options that won't leave you scrambling in the morning. Now get out there and conquer your day. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that happened at my local library last week. So like, I'm there looking for this obscure book about urban legends, right? And I stumble into this hidden reading room I never knew existed. I mean, it's filled with these ancient looking maps and weird artifacts. But here's a thing. Turns out this secret club for people who investigate unexplained mysteries in the city. They've been meeting there for decades, documenting everything from mysterious sounds and the subway tunnels to unexplain lights over the park. I mean, these people are totally serious about it too. They've got spreadsheets, surveillance equipment, the whole deal. And the library and who showed me around. She's been running this thing since the 80s. But yeah, now I'm kind of hooked. Like I spent three hours last night cataloging reports of spontaneous music coming from empty buildings. So my neighbor Tom, you know, the quiet guy who works in accounting, turns out he's got this absolutely insane hobby. Get this. He's been building a miniature replica of the entire city in his basement. But I mean, not just any replica, this thing has working streetlights. Tiny cars that actually move around on tracks and these incredibly detailed business with tiny people living their tiny lives inside. And like he's programmed this whole system to mirror real time traffic patterns from Google Maps. The whole setup takes up his entire basement. He's been working on it for seven years and he estimates it'll take 12 to complete. The dedication is honestly kind of inspiring. His wife just rolls her eyes whenever anyone brings it up. So here's the thing about this new cafe that opened up downtown. It looks totally normal from the outside. But once you step in, everything gets weird in the best possible way. They've got this menu that changes based on your mood. Like you walk in, feeling stressed and suddenly the special of the day is this crazy blue tea that supposedly helps with anxiety. The barista, this fascinating woman with silver hair and about a thousand stories, she says they use some kind of advanced AI to read micro expressions. But I mean, sometimes she seems to know what you need before you even walk through the door. The regulars all have theories about her. Something she's a time traveler, others say she's just really good at reading people. The coffee's amazing either way. You know what's been absolutely messing with my head lately, the situation at work. And like it started with something so simple, just a plan on my desk. This little succulent, nothing special. But then people started leaving notes next to it, confessing these really deep secrets. It became this weird anonymous, confessional spot. But I mean, some of these secrets are wild. Someone admitted to having a second family in Canada, another person revealed that they've been secretly learning circus arts for five years. The whole thing snowballed. And now there's this entire mythology around this plant. People leave offerings, cookies, small trinkets, weird origami. Management tried to remove it once, but that was nearly a revolt. Now they just pretend it doesn't exist. And yeah, speaking of weird work stuff, my friend Sarah just started this new job at what she thought was a normal tech company. But I mean, nothing about this place is normal. The CEO insists on conducting all meetings while walking backwards. Something about reverse engineering problems. They've got this thing where every Thursday, everyone has to speak in rhymes. The coffee machine only works if you tell it a joke. But here's a crazy part. They're incredibly successful. Like industry leading successful. Makes you wonder if we're all doing it wrong with our normal, forward walking meetings and joke free coffee machines. Let me tell you about this absolute chaos that unfolded at my cousin's wedding last month. So like everything was going perfectly normal until the best man's speech. He starts talking complete routine stuff. Then suddenly this elderly woman stands up and announces that she's actually the groom's long lost aunt, who's presumed dead in a skiing accident 20 years ago. But I mean, she wasn't even invited. Just walked in off the street. The whole room went silent. And like she turns out, she's not even related to anyone there. She just goes around to random weddings doing this. Apparently she's some kind of local legend. Some people even try to spot her at weddings now. Like some kind of wedding crash or bingo. I've been taking these pottery classes recently and honestly, the whole experience has been surreal. The instructor, this absolutely fascinating guy who used to be a quantum physicist, he teaches everything through physics metaphors. But I mean, it actually works. He'll start talking about particle behavior and suddenly your bowl isn't collapsing anymore. And like the class has attracted this weird mix of people. There's a former circus clown who makes these incredibly detailed miniature carousels a detective who only works on cold cases and this mysterious person who shows up completely covered and glitter every single time. Nobody knows their story. And at this point, everyone's too afraid to ask. Yeah, so my sister's been working on this really interesting research project at the university. She's been studying how different types of music affect plant growth. But it's gotten completely out of hand. And like she's got this greenhouse full of plants listening to everything from death metal to classical opera. I mean, the results are wild. The plants listen to heavy metal are growing. These incredibly thick, sturdy stems while the ones listening to jazz are growing in this weird improvisational patterns. The classical music section looks like something out of a Victorian garden party. The university's bottomary department doesn't know what to make of it. But the music department has started holding concerts in the greenhouse. So here's the thing about this new restaurant that opened up in my neighborhood. They've taken the concept of diner theater to a whole new level. The entire staff are actually undercover actors participating in an ongoing mystery story that changes every night. But I mean, they never take a break. They never break character. Even when things go completely sideways. Last time I was there, what started out as a simple diner turned into that is a elaborate plot involving international espionage, a missing recipe, and a pet parrot who knew too much. And like you never know if the person sitting next to you is another customer or part of the story. The food is actually amazing too, which seems almost secondary to the whole experience. The health inspector visits last month accidentally became part of the storyline about a time traveling food critic from the year 2150. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that's happening in my apartment building. Somebody started an anonymous wrote note writing chain that turned into this build building wide storytelling experiment. And like it started with just one note in the elevator asking people to share their most interesting dream. But here's a thing. Now the entire building is turned into this collaborative writing project. The laundry room has become a romance chapter. The lobby is for plot twists and the mail room is strictly for character development. But I mean, nobody knows who started it and somehow that makes it even better. The building manager tried to stop it until she got completely hooked on the storyline developing in the recycling area. Yeah, so my cousin started this underground appreciation society for really specific things. Like not just books or movies but super niche stuff. And like they meet in different places every month to collaborate these incredibly specific topics. I mean last month was dedicated to the sound of tennis shoes, the sound that tennis shoes make on freshly waxed floors. Before that they spent an entire evening discussing and recreating that specific smell of photocopy paper. The meetings are getting bigger every month. They had to rent out an entire warehouse for the celebration on the particular way some light looks when it comes through half closed blinds on a dusty afternoon. The whole thing is ridiculously specific but somehow deeply relatable. So here's a thing about this new app my friend developed. It's designed to connect people based on their most embarrassing moments. But I mean, it's actually becoming really popular. Instead of showing your best self, instead of showing your best self, you have to lead with your most awkward stories. And like people are forming these incredible friendships over shared experiences of walking in the glass doors or calling their teacher mom and high school. The more cringe-worthy the story, the more connections you make. And they're even organizing meetups now where everyone has to recreate their embarrassing moment as an icebreaker. Somehow it's the most honest social network I've ever seen. At this point, but whatever just friendship and the digital age pretending you're going to consume hours of content just to be polite. You want to hear something kind of ridiculous? My recent attempt at meal prepping. So anyway, but all these fancy containers color-coded everything. I mean, yeah, I spent an entire Sunday cooking just feeling like I had my life together for once. But by Wednesday, order take out again. All these perfectly plan meals just sitting there judging from my fridge. And like now I've got this container collection that's basically expensive topware for leftovers all probably forget about. The whole situation with trying to be environmentally conscious, getting pretty complicated. I mean, just standing in the grocery store, having an existential crisis over which type of milk is actually better for the planet. So like regular milk, bad for the environment. All men milk apparently uses too much water. Oh milk, I don't know, probably has its own issues. But yeah, just paralyzed in the dairy aisle, contemplating the environmental impact of breakfast choices. The thing with social media memories popping up kind of a psychological roller coaster. Like just going about your day and suddenly your phone shows you something from five years ago. I mean, yeah, photos, you don't even remember taking posts that make you cringe, just your past self and bushing your present self. And so I guess that's what we have to do with now. Random reminders of our questionable fashion choices and old relationships. But whatever, at least it's entertaining in a sort of mortifying way. The whole DIY furniture trend is taking an interesting turn in my life. I mean, yeah, bought this desk online. One of those easy assembly things. But like three hours in, just sitting there surrounded by random pieces. Instructions that make it, might as well be ancient hieroglyphics. And so I know that's how my living room became this weird furniture of a graveyard, just parts everywhere. The funny thing started using this box that came in as a temporary desk. But whatever, maybe that's just a real DIY finding creative ways to avoid actual assembly. Hey, there fellow gamers ready to up your fortnight game. Let's dive into those advanced building techniques. Start by honing your skills in creative mode to master different structures.

Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, he told me, just remember that all the people in the world haven't had the advantages that you've had. He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way. And I understand that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments. A habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran boars. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person. And so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician because I was privy to secrets of the wild unknown men. Most of the conferences were unsought. Frequently I have famed sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on a horizon. For the intimate revelations of young men or at least in terms of which they expressed them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Having judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forgot that as my father snobbishly suggested. And I snobbishly repeat, a sense of fundamental decencies is puzzled out on equally a birth. And after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. One duck may be founded on hard rock or wet marshes, but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. I came back to the east last autumn. I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and a sort of moral attention forever. I wanted no more righteous excursions with privileged climpses into a human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction. That's me, who represented everything for which I have unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, there was something gorgeous about him, some unhightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if they were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes 10,000 miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with what Flabby and Prussian ability, which was dignified under the name of creative temperament. It was an extraordinary gift of hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person in which is not likely I shall ever find again. No, Gatsby turned out all right at the end. It is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and show short-winded relations of men. My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city of three generations. The caroways are something of a clan, and we have tradition that were descended from the Duke's suburluck. But the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother, who came here in 51, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started a wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today. And so with the sunshine and the great burst of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had a familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health that would pull down out of the young breath, giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf and read and gold like new money from the mint, promising unfold shining secrets that only might us in Morgan and Messianess knew. I had an eye-had high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college, one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale news. And now I was going back to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the well-rounded man. This is in just an epigram. Life is more successfully looked at from a single window after all. It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. I was on that slender, righteous island which extends itself to east of New York and where there are among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, just out into the most domesticated body of water in a western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals, like the egg and Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end, but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the goals that fly overhead. To the wingless, a more arresting phenomenon is their dismissalarity in the every peculiar except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, the well, the less fashionable of the two. This was the most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between men. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only 50 yards from the sound and squeeze between two huge places that rented for 12 and 15,000 a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard. It was a factual limitation of the hotel, the vill, and Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking you under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than 40 acres of lawn and garden. Those gatsby's mention, or rather, as I did a no Mr. Gatby, it was a mention inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an I-sore, but it was a small I-sore, and it had been overlooked. So I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires, all for $80 a month. Across the bay, the white palaces, a fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins in the evening. I drove over there to have dinner with Tom Buchanan's. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I known Tom and College. At last, after the war, I spent two days with him in Chicago. Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that played football at New Haven, a national figure in a way, one whose men, who reached such acute, limited excellence at 21, that everything afterwards savers and anti-climax, his family were enormously wealthy, even in the commonwealth, his freedom with money was a matter of reproach, but now he'd left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away. For instance, he brought down a string of polo ponies from the lake forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my generation was wealthy enough to do that. When they came east, I didn't know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played solo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy of the telephone, but I didn't believe it. I had no sight in the Daisy's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence or sometimes irrecoverable football game. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that happened at my local library last week. So like, I'm there looking for this obscure book about urban legends, right? And I stumble into this hidden reading room I never knew existed. I mean, it's filled with these ancient looking maps and weird artifacts, but here's a thing. It turns out this secret club for people who investigated unexplained mysteries in the city. They've been meeting there for decades documenting everything from mysterious sounds in the subway tunnels to unexplained lights in the park. I mean, these people were totally serious about it too. They've got spreadsheets, surveillance equipment, the whole deal. And the library and who showed me around, she's been running this thing since the 80s. But yeah, I know, I'm kind of hooked. Like, spent three hours last night cataloging reports and spontaneous music coming from empty buildings. Yeah. So my neighbor Tom, you know, the quiet guy who works on accounting, turns out he's got this absolutely insane hobby. Get this. He's been building a miniature replica of the entire city in his basement. But I mean, not just any replica. This thing is work streetlights, tiny cars that actually move around tracks. This thing is incredibly detailed business buildings with tiny people living their tiny lives inside. And like, he's programmed this whole system to mirror real time traffic patterns from Google Maps. His whole setup takes up his entire basement. He's been working on it for seven years. He's estimated it'll take 12 to complete. The dedication is honestly kind of inspiring. His wife just rolls her eyes wherever he anyone brings it up. So here's the thing about this new cafe that opened up downtown. It looks absolutely normal from the outside. But once you step in, everything gets weird in the best possible way. They've got this menu that change based on your mood. Like you walk in feeling stressed and suddenly the special of the day is this crazy blue tea that supposedly helps with anxiety. The barista, this fascinating woman with silver hair in about a thousand stories, she says they use some kind of advanced AI to read micro expressions. But I mean, sometimes she seems to know what you need before you even walk through the door. The regulars all have stories about her. I think she's a time traveler. Others say she's just really good at reading people. The coffee's amazing either way. Hey there fellow gamers. Ready to up your Fortnite game? Let's dive into these advanced building techniques.

Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that happened at my local library last week. So like, I'm there looking for this obscure book about urban legends, right? And I stumble into this hidden reading room I never knew existed. I mean, it's filled with these ancient looking maps and weird artifacts. But here's a thing. Turns out this secret club for people who investigate unexplained mysteries in the city. They've been meeting there for decades, documenting everything from mysterious sounds and the subway tunnels to unexplain lights over the park. I mean, these people are totally serious about it too. They've got spreadsheets, surveillance equipment, the whole deal. And the library and who showed me around. She's been running this thing since the 80s. But yeah, now I'm kind of hooked. Like I spent three hours last night cataloging reports of spontaneous music coming from empty buildings. So my neighbor Tom, you know, the quiet guy who works in accounting, turns out he's got this absolutely insane hobby. Get this. He's been building a miniature replica of the entire city in his basement. But I mean, not just any replica, this thing has working streetlights. Tiny cars that actually move around on tracks and these incredibly detailed business with tiny people living their tiny lives inside. And like he's programmed this whole system to mirror real time traffic patterns from Google Maps. The whole setup takes up his entire basement. He's been working on it for seven years and he estimates it'll take 12 to complete. The dedication is honestly kind of inspiring. His wife just rolls her eyes whenever anyone brings it up. So here's the thing about this new cafe that opened up downtown. It looks totally normal from the outside. But once you step in, everything gets weird in the best possible way. They've got this menu that changes based on your mood. Like you walk in, feeling stressed and suddenly the special of the day is this crazy blue tea that supposedly helps with anxiety. The barista, this fascinating woman with silver hair and about a thousand stories, she says they use some kind of advanced AI to read micro expressions. But I mean, sometimes she seems to know what you need before you even walk through the door. The regulars all have theories about her. Something she's a time traveler, others say she's just really good at reading people. The coffee's amazing either way. You know what's been absolutely messing with my head lately, the situation at work. And like it started with something so simple, just a plan on my desk. This little succulent, nothing special. But then people started leaving notes next to it, confessing these really deep secrets. It became this weird anonymous, confessional spot. But I mean, some of these secrets are wild. Someone admitted to having a second family in Canada, another person revealed that they've been secretly learning circus arts for five years. The whole thing snowballed. And now there's this entire mythology around this plant. People leave offerings, cookies, small trinkets, weird origami. Management tried to remove it once, but that was nearly a revolt. Now they just pretend it doesn't exist. And yeah, speaking of weird work stuff, my friend Sarah just started this new job at what she thought was a normal tech company. But I mean, nothing about this place is normal. The CEO insists on conducting all meetings while walking backwards. Something about reverse engineering problems. They've got this thing where every Thursday, everyone has to speak in rhymes. The coffee machine only works if you tell it a joke. But here's a crazy part. They're incredibly successful. Like industry leading successful. Makes you wonder if we're all doing it wrong with our normal, forward walking meetings and joke free coffee machines. Let me tell you about this absolute chaos that unfolded at my cousin's wedding last month. So like everything was going perfectly normal until the best man's speech. He starts talking complete routine stuff. Then suddenly this elderly woman stands up and announces that she's actually the groom's long lost aunt, who's presumed dead in a skiing accident 20 years ago. But I mean, she wasn't even invited. Just walked in off the street. The whole room went silent. And like she turns out, she's not even related to anyone there. She just goes around to random weddings doing this. Apparently she's some kind of local legend. Some people even try to spot her at weddings now. Like some kind of wedding crash or bingo. I've been taking these pottery classes recently and honestly, the whole experience has been surreal. The instructor, this absolutely fascinating guy who used to be a quantum physicist, he teaches everything through physics metaphors. But I mean, it actually works. He'll start talking about particle behavior and suddenly your bowl isn't collapsing anymore. And like the class has attracted this weird mix of people. There's a former circus clown who makes these incredibly detailed miniature carousels a detective who only works on cold cases and this mysterious person who shows up completely covered and glitter every single time. Nobody knows their story. And at this point, everyone's too afraid to ask. Yeah, so my sister's been working on this really interesting research project at the university. She's been studying how different types of music affect plant growth. But it's gotten completely out of hand. And like she's got this greenhouse full of plants listening to everything from death metal to classical opera. I mean, the results are wild. The plants listen to heavy metal are growing. These incredibly thick, sturdy stems while the ones listening to jazz are growing in this weird improvisational patterns. The classical music section looks like something out of a Victorian garden party. The university's bottomary department doesn't know what to make of it. But the music department has started holding concerts in the greenhouse. So here's the thing about this new restaurant that opened up in my neighborhood. They've taken the concept of diner theater to a whole new level. The entire staff are actually undercover actors participating in an ongoing mystery story that changes every night. But I mean, they never take a break. They never break character. Even when things go completely sideways. Last time I was there, what started out as a simple diner turned into that is a elaborate plot involving international espionage, a missing recipe, and a pet parrot who knew too much. And like you never know if the person sitting next to you is another customer or part of the story. The food is actually amazing too, which seems almost secondary to the whole experience. The health inspector visits last month accidentally became part of the storyline about a time traveling food critic from the year 2150. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that's happening in my apartment building. Somebody started an anonymous wrote note writing chain that turned into this build building wide storytelling experiment. And like it started with just one note in the elevator asking people to share their most interesting dream. But here's a thing. Now the entire building is turned into this collaborative writing project. The laundry room has become a romance chapter. The lobby is for plot twists and the mail room is strictly for character development. But I mean, nobody knows who started it and somehow that makes it even better. The building manager tried to stop it until she got completely hooked on the storyline developing in the recycling area. Yeah, so my cousin started this underground appreciation society for really specific things. Like not just books or movies but super niche stuff. And like they meet in different places every month to collaborate these incredibly specific topics. I mean last month was dedicated to the sound of tennis shoes, the sound that tennis shoes make on freshly waxed floors. Before that they spent an entire evening discussing and recreating that specific smell of photocopy paper. The meetings are getting bigger every month. They had to rent out an entire warehouse for the celebration on the particular way some light looks when it comes through half closed blinds on a dusty afternoon. The whole thing is ridiculously specific but somehow deeply relatable. So here's a thing about this new app my friend developed. It's designed to connect people based on their most embarrassing moments. But I mean, it's actually becoming really popular. Instead of showing your best self, instead of showing your best self, you have to lead with your most awkward stories. And like people are forming these incredible friendships over shared experiences of walking in the glass doors or calling their teacher mom and high school. The more cringe-worthy the story, the more connections you make. And they're even organizing meetups now where everyone has to recreate their embarrassing moment as an icebreaker. Somehow it's the most honest social network I've ever seen. At this point, but whatever just friendship and the digital age pretending you're going to consume hours of content just to be polite. You want to hear something kind of ridiculous? My recent attempt at meal prepping. So anyway, but all these fancy containers color-coded everything. I mean, yeah, I spent an entire Sunday cooking just feeling like I had my life together for once. But by Wednesday, order take out again. All these perfectly plan meals just sitting there judging from my fridge. And like now I've got this container collection that's basically expensive topware for leftovers all probably forget about. The whole situation with trying to be environmentally conscious, getting pretty complicated. I mean, just standing in the grocery store, having an existential crisis over which type of milk is actually better for the planet. So like regular milk, bad for the environment. All men milk apparently uses too much water. Oh milk, I don't know, probably has its own issues. But yeah, just paralyzed in the dairy aisle, contemplating the environmental impact of breakfast choices. The thing with social media memories popping up kind of a psychological roller coaster. Like just going about your day and suddenly your phone shows you something from five years ago. I mean, yeah, photos, you don't even remember taking posts that make you cringe, just your past self and bushing your present self. And so I guess that's what we have to do with now. Random reminders of our questionable fashion choices and old relationships. But whatever, at least it's entertaining in a sort of mortifying way. The whole DIY furniture trend is taking an interesting turn in my life. I mean, yeah, bought this desk online. One of those easy assembly things. But like three hours in, just sitting there surrounded by random pieces. Instructions that make it, might as well be ancient hieroglyphics. And so I know that's how my living room became this weird furniture of a graveyard, just parts everywhere. The funny thing started using this box that came in as a temporary desk. But whatever, maybe that's just a real DIY finding creative ways to avoid actual assembly. Hey, there fellow gamers ready to up your fortnight game.

Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, he told me, just remember that all the people in the world haven't had the advantages that you've had. He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way. And I understand that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments. A habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran boars. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person. And so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician because I was privy to secrets of the wild unknown men. Most of the conferences were unsought. Frequently I have famed sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on a horizon. For the intimate revelations of young men or at least in terms of which they expressed them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Having judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forgot that as my father snobbishly suggested. And I snobbishly repeat, a sense of fundamental decencies is puzzled out on equally a birth. And after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. One duck may be founded on hard rock or wet marshes, but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. I came back to the east last autumn. I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and a sort of moral attention forever. I wanted no more righteous excursions with privileged climpses into a human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction. That's me, who represented everything for which I have unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, there was something gorgeous about him, some unhightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if they were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes 10,000 miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with what Flabby and Prussian ability, which was dignified under the name of creative temperament. It was an extraordinary gift of hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person in which is not likely I shall ever find again. No, Gatsby turned out all right at the end. It is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and show short-winded relations of men. My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city of three generations. The caroways are something of a clan, and we have tradition that were descended from the Duke's suburluck. But the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother, who came here in 51, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started a wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today. And so with the sunshine and the great burst of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had a familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health that would pull down out of the young breath, giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf and read and gold like new money from the mint, promising unfold shining secrets that only might us in Morgan and Messianess knew. I had an eye-had high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college, one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale news. And now I was going back to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the well-rounded man. This is in just an epigram. Life is more successfully looked at from a single window after all. It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. I was on that slender, righteous island which extends itself to east of New York and where there are among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, just out into the most domesticated body of water in a western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals, like the egg and Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end, but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the goals that fly overhead. To the wingless, a more arresting phenomenon is their dismissalarity in the every peculiar except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, the well, the less fashionable of the two.

I had no sight in the Daisy's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence or sometimes irrecoverable football game. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that happened at my local library last week. So like, I'm there looking for this obscure book about urban legends, right? And I stumble into this hidden reading room I never knew existed. I mean, it's filled with these ancient looking maps and weird artifacts, but here's a thing. It turns out this secret club for people who investigated unexplained mysteries in the city. They've been meeting there for decades documenting everything from mysterious sounds in the subway tunnels to unexplained lights in the park. I mean, these people were totally serious about it too. They've got spreadsheets, surveillance equipment, the whole deal. And the library and who showed me around, she's been running this thing since the 80s. But yeah, I know, I'm kind of hooked. Like, spent three hours last night cataloging reports and spontaneous music coming from empty buildings. Yeah. So my neighbor Tom, you know, the quiet guy who works on accounting, turns out he's got this absolutely insane hobby. Get this. He's been building a miniature replica of the entire city in his basement. But I mean, not just any replica. This thing is work streetlights, tiny cars that actually move around tracks. This thing is incredibly detailed business buildings with tiny people living their tiny lives inside. And like, he's programmed this whole system to mirror real time traffic patterns from Google Maps. His whole setup takes up his entire basement. He's been working on it for seven years. He's estimated it'll take 12 to complete. The dedication is honestly kind of inspiring. His wife just rolls her eyes wherever he anyone brings it up. So here's the thing about this new cafe that opened up downtown. It looks absolutely normal from the outside. But once you step in, everything gets weird in the best possible way. They've got this menu that change based on your mood. Like you walk in feeling stressed and suddenly the special of the day is this crazy blue tea that supposedly helps with anxiety.

But I mean, sometimes she seems to know what you need before you even walk through the door. The regulars all have stories about her. I think she's a time traveler.

Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that happened at my local library last week. So like, I'm there looking for this obscure book about urban legends, right? And I stumble into this hidden reading room I never knew existed. I mean, it's filled with these ancient looking maps and weird artifacts. But here's a thing. Turns out this secret club for people who investigate unexplained mysteries in the city. They've been meeting there for decades, documenting everything from mysterious sounds and the subway tunnels to unexplain lights over the park. I mean, these people are totally serious about it too. They've got spreadsheets, surveillance equipment, the whole deal. And the library and who showed me around. She's been running this thing since the 80s. But yeah, now I'm kind of hooked. Like I spent three hours last night cataloging reports of spontaneous music coming from empty buildings. So my neighbor Tom, you know, the quiet guy who works in accounting, turns out he's got this absolutely insane hobby. Get this. He's been building a miniature replica of the entire city in his basement. But I mean, not just any replica, this thing has working streetlights. Tiny cars that actually move around on tracks and these incredibly detailed business with tiny people living their tiny lives inside. And like he's programmed this whole system to mirror real time traffic patterns from Google Maps. The whole setup takes up his entire basement. He's been working on it for seven years and he estimates it'll take 12 to complete. The dedication is honestly kind of inspiring. His wife just rolls her eyes whenever anyone brings it up. So here's the thing about this new cafe that opened up downtown. It looks totally normal from the outside. But once you step in, everything gets weird in the best possible way. They've got this menu that changes based on your mood. Like you walk in, feeling stressed and suddenly the special of the day is this crazy blue tea that supposedly helps with anxiety. The barista, this fascinating woman with silver hair and about a thousand stories, she says they use some kind of advanced AI to read micro expressions. But I mean, sometimes she seems to know what you need before you even walk through the door. The regulars all have theories about her. Something she's a time traveler, others say she's just really good at reading people. The coffee's amazing either way. You know what's been absolutely messing with my head lately, the situation at work. And like it started with something so simple, just a plan on my desk. This little succulent, nothing special. But then people started leaving notes next to it, confessing these really deep secrets. It became this weird anonymous, confessional spot. But I mean, some of these secrets are wild. Someone admitted to having a second family in Canada, another person revealed that they've been secretly learning circus arts for five years. The whole thing snowballed. And now there's this entire mythology around this plant. People leave offerings, cookies, small trinkets, weird origami. Management tried to remove it once, but that was nearly a revolt. Now they just pretend it doesn't exist. And yeah, speaking of weird work stuff, my friend Sarah just started this new job at what she thought was a normal tech company. But I mean, nothing about this place is normal. The CEO insists on conducting all meetings while walking backwards. Something about reverse engineering problems. They've got this thing where every Thursday, everyone has to speak in rhymes. The coffee machine only works if you tell it a joke. But here's a crazy part. They're incredibly successful. Like industry leading successful. Makes you wonder if we're all doing it wrong with our normal, forward walking meetings and joke free coffee machines. Let me tell you about this absolute chaos that unfolded at my cousin's wedding last month. So like everything was going perfectly normal until the best man's speech. He starts talking complete routine stuff. Then suddenly this elderly woman stands up and announces that she's actually the groom's long lost aunt, who's presumed dead in a skiing accident 20 years ago. But I mean, she wasn't even invited. Just walked in off the street. The whole room went silent. And like she turns out, she's not even related to anyone there. She just goes around to random weddings doing this. Apparently she's some kind of local legend. Some people even try to spot her at weddings now. Like some kind of wedding crash or bingo. I've been taking these pottery classes recently and honestly, the whole experience has been surreal. The instructor, this absolutely fascinating guy who used to be a quantum physicist, he teaches everything through physics metaphors. But I mean, it actually works. He'll start talking about particle behavior and suddenly your bowl isn't collapsing anymore. And like the class has attracted this weird mix of people. There's a former circus clown who makes these incredibly detailed miniature carousels a detective who only works on cold cases and this mysterious person who shows up completely covered and glitter every single time. Nobody knows their story. And at this point, everyone's too afraid to ask. Yeah, so my sister's been working on this really interesting research project at the university. She's been studying how different types of music affect plant growth. But it's gotten completely out of hand. And like she's got this greenhouse full of plants listening to everything from death metal to classical opera. I mean, the results are wild. The plants listen to heavy metal are growing. These incredibly thick, sturdy stems while the ones listening to jazz are growing in this weird improvisational patterns. The classical music section looks like something out of a Victorian garden party. The university's bottomary department doesn't know what to make of it. But the music department has started holding concerts in the greenhouse. So here's the thing about this new restaurant that opened up in my neighborhood. They've taken the concept of diner theater to a whole new level. The entire staff are actually undercover actors participating in an ongoing mystery story that changes every night. But I mean, they never take a break. They never break character. Even when things go completely sideways. Last time I was there, what started out as a simple diner turned into that is a elaborate plot involving international espionage, a missing recipe, and a pet parrot who knew too much. And like you never know if the person sitting next to you is another customer or part of the story. The food is actually amazing too, which seems almost secondary to the whole experience. The health inspector visits last month accidentally became part of the storyline about a time traveling food critic from the year 2150. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that's happening in my apartment building. Somebody started an anonymous wrote note writing chain that turned into this build building wide storytelling experiment. And like it started with just one note in the elevator asking people to share their most interesting dream. But here's a thing. Now the entire building is turned into this collaborative writing project. The laundry room has become a romance chapter. The lobby is for plot twists and the mail room is strictly for character development. But I mean, nobody knows who started it and somehow that makes it even better. The building manager tried to stop it until she got completely hooked on the storyline developing in the recycling area. Yeah, so my cousin started this underground appreciation society for really specific things. Like not just books or movies but super niche stuff. And like they meet in different places every month to collaborate these incredibly specific topics. I mean last month was dedicated to the sound of tennis shoes, the sound that tennis shoes make on freshly waxed floors. Before that they spent an entire evening discussing and recreating that specific smell of photocopy paper. The meetings are getting bigger every month. They had to rent out an entire warehouse for the celebration on the particular way some light looks when it comes through half closed blinds on a dusty afternoon. The whole thing is ridiculously specific but somehow deeply relatable. So here's a thing about this new app my friend developed. It's designed to connect people based on their most embarrassing moments. But I mean, it's actually becoming really popular. Instead of showing your best self, instead of showing your best self, you have to lead with your most awkward stories. And like people are forming these incredible friendships over shared experiences of walking in the glass doors or calling their teacher mom and high school. The more cringe-worthy the story, the more connections you make. And they're even organizing meetups now where everyone has to recreate their embarrassing moment as an icebreaker. Somehow it's the most honest social network I've ever seen. At this point, but whatever just friendship and the digital age pretending you're going to consume hours of content just to be polite. You want to hear something kind of ridiculous? My recent attempt at meal prepping. So anyway, but all these fancy containers color-coded everything. I mean, yeah, I spent an entire Sunday cooking just feeling like I had my life together for once. But by Wednesday, order take out again. All these perfectly plan meals just sitting there judging from my fridge. And like now I've got this container collection that's basically expensive topware for leftovers all probably forget about. The whole situation with trying to be environmentally conscious, getting pretty complicated. I mean, just standing in the grocery store, having an existential crisis over which type of milk is actually better for the planet. So like regular milk, bad for the environment. All men milk apparently uses too much water. Oh milk, I don't know, probably has its own issues. But yeah, just paralyzed in the dairy aisle, contemplating the environmental impact of breakfast choices. The thing with social media memories popping up kind of a psychological roller coaster. Like just going about your day and suddenly your phone shows you something from five years ago. I mean, yeah, photos, you don't even remember taking posts that make you cringe, just your past self and bushing your present self. And so I guess that's what we have to do with now. Random reminders of our questionable fashion choices and old relationships. But whatever, at least it's entertaining in a sort of mortifying way. The whole DIY furniture trend is taking an interesting turn in my life. I mean, yeah, bought this desk online. One of those easy assembly things. But like three hours in, just sitting there surrounded by random pieces. Instructions that make it, might as well be ancient hieroglyphics. And so I know that's how my living room became this weird furniture of a graveyard, just parts everywhere. The funny thing started using this box that came in as a temporary desk. But whatever, maybe that's just a real DIY finding creative ways to avoid actual assembly. Hey, there fellow gamers ready to up your fortnight game.

Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, he told me, just remember that all the people in the world haven't had the advantages that you've had. He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way. And I understand that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments. A habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran boars. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person. And so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician because I was privy to secrets of the wild unknown men. Most of the conferences were unsought. Frequently I have famed sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on a horizon. For the intimate revelations of young men or at least in terms of which they expressed them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Having judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forgot that as my father snobbishly suggested. And I snobbishly repeat, a sense of fundamental decencies is puzzled out on equally a birth. And after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. One duck may be founded on hard rock or wet marshes, but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. I came back to the east last autumn. I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and a sort of moral attention forever. I wanted no more righteous excursions with privileged climpses into a human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction. That's me, who represented everything for which I have unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, there was something gorgeous about him, some unhightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if they were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes 10,000 miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with what Flabby and Prussian ability, which was dignified under the name of creative temperament. It was an extraordinary gift of hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person in which is not likely I shall ever find again. No, Gatsby turned out all right at the end. It is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and show short-winded relations of men. My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city of three generations. The caroways are something of a clan, and we have tradition that were descended from the Duke's suburluck. But the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother, who came here in 51, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started a wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today. And so with the sunshine and the great burst of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had a familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer. There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health that would pull down out of the young breath, giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf and read and gold like new money from the mint, promising unfold shining secrets that only might us in Morgan and Messianess knew. I had an eye-had high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college, one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale news. And now I was going back to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the well-rounded man. This is in just an epigram. Life is more successfully looked at from a single window after all. It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. I was on that slender, righteous island which extends itself to east of New York and where there are among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, just out into the most domesticated body of water in a western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals, like the egg and Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end, but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the goals that fly overhead. To the wingless, a more arresting phenomenon is their dismissalarity in the every peculiar except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, the well, the less fashionable of the two. This was the most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between men. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only 50 yards from the sound and squeeze between two huge places that rented for 12 and 15,000 a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard. It was a factual limitation of the hotel, the vill, and Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking you under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than 40 acres of lawn and garden. Those gatsby's mention, or rather, as I did a no Mr. Gatby, it was a mention inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an I-sore, but it was a small I-sore, and it had been overlooked. So I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires, all for $80 a month. Across the bay, the white palaces, a fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins in the evening. I drove over there to have dinner with Tom Buchanan's. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I known Tom and College. At last, after the war, I spent two days with him in Chicago. Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that played football at New Haven, a national figure in a way, one whose men, who reached such acute, limited excellence at 21, that everything afterwards savers and anti-climax, his family were enormously wealthy, even in the commonwealth, his freedom with money was a matter of reproach, but now he'd left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away. For instance, he brought down a string of polo ponies from the lake forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my generation was wealthy enough to do that. When they came east, I didn't know. They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played solo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy of the telephone, but I didn't believe it. I had no sight in the Daisy's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence or sometimes irrecoverable football game. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that happened at my local library last week. So like, I'm there looking for this obscure book about urban legends, right? And I stumble into this hidden reading room I never knew existed. I mean, it's filled with these ancient looking maps and weird artifacts, but here's a thing.

He starts talking complete routine stuff. Then suddenly this elderly woman stands up and announces that she's actually the groom's long lost aunt, who's presumed dead in a skiing accident 20 years ago. But I mean, she wasn't even invited. Just walked in off the street. The whole room went silent. And like she turns out, she's not even related to anyone there. She just goes around to random weddings doing this. Apparently she's some kind of local legend. Some people even try to spot her at weddings now. Like some kind of wedding crash or bingo. I've been taking these pottery classes recently and honestly, the whole experience has been surreal. The instructor, this absolutely fascinating guy who used to be a quantum physicist, he teaches everything through physics metaphors. But I mean, it actually works. He'll start talking about particle behavior and suddenly your bowl isn't collapsing anymore. And like the class has attracted this weird mix of people. There's a former circus clown who makes these incredibly detailed miniature carousels a detective who only works on cold cases and this mysterious person who shows up completely covered and glitter every single time. Nobody knows their story. And at this point, everyone's too afraid to ask. Yeah, so my sister's been working on this really interesting research project at the university. She's been studying how different types of music affect plant growth. But it's gotten completely out of hand. And like she's got this greenhouse full of plants listening to everything from death metal to classical opera. I mean, the results are wild. The plants listen to heavy metal are growing. These incredibly thick, sturdy stems while the ones listening to jazz are growing in this weird improvisational patterns. The classical music section looks like something out of a Victorian garden party. The university's bottomary department doesn't know what to make of it. But the music department has started holding concerts in the greenhouse. So here's the thing about this new restaurant that opened up in my neighborhood. They've taken the concept of diner theater to a whole new level. The entire staff are actually undercover actors participating in an ongoing mystery story that changes every night. But I mean, they never take a break. They never break character. Even when things go completely sideways. Last time I was there, what started out as a simple diner turned into that is a elaborate plot involving international espionage, a missing recipe, and a pet parrot who knew too much. And like you never know if the person sitting next to you is another customer or part of the story. The food is actually amazing too, which seems almost secondary to the whole experience. The health inspector visits last month accidentally became part of the storyline about a time traveling food critic from the year 2150. Let me tell you about this absolutely wild thing that's happening in my apartment building. Somebody started an anonymous wrote note writing chain that turned into this build building wide storytelling experiment. And like it started with just one note in the elevator asking people to share their most interesting dream. But here's a thing. Now the entire building is turned into this collaborative writing project. The laundry room has become a romance chapter. The lobby is for plot twists and the mail room is strictly for character development. But I mean, nobody knows who started it and somehow that makes it even better. The building manager tried to stop it until she got completely hooked on the storyline developing in the recycling area. Yeah, so my cousin started this underground appreciation society for really specific things. Like not just books or movies but super niche stuff. And like they meet in different places every month to collaborate these incredibly specific topics. I mean last month was dedicated to the sound of tennis shoes, the sound that tennis shoes make on freshly waxed floors. Before that they spent an entire evening discussing and recreating that specific smell of photocopy paper. The meetings are getting bigger every month. They had to rent out an entire warehouse for the celebration on the particular way some light looks when it comes through half closed blinds on a dusty afternoon. The whole thing is ridiculously specific but somehow deeply relatable. So here's a thing about this new app my friend developed. It's designed to connect people based on their most embarrassing moments. But I mean, it's actually becoming really popular. Instead of showing your best self, instead of showing your best self, you have to lead with your most awkward stories. And like people are forming these incredible friendships over shared experiences of walking in the glass doors or calling their teacher mom and high school. The more cringe-worthy the story, the more connections you make. And they're even organizing meetups now where everyone has to recreate their embarrassing moment as an icebreaker. Somehow it's the most honest social network I've ever seen. At this point, but whatever just friendship and the digital age pretending you're going to consume hours of content just to be polite. You want to hear something kind of ridiculous? My recent attempt at meal prepping. So anyway, but all these fancy containers color-coded everything. I mean, yeah, I spent an entire Sunday cooking just feeling like I had my life together for once. But by Wednesday, order take out again. All these perfectly plan meals just sitting there judging from my fridge. And like now I've got this container collection that's basically expensive topware for leftovers all probably forget about. The whole situation with trying to be environmentally conscious, getting pretty complicated. I mean, just standing in the grocery store, having an existential crisis over which type of milk is actually better for the planet. So like regular milk, bad for the environment. All men milk apparently uses too much water. Oh milk, I don't know, probably has its own issues. But yeah, just paralyzed in the dairy aisle, contemplating the environmental impact of breakfast choices. The thing with social media memories popping up kind of a psychological roller coaster. Like just going about your day and suddenly your phone shows you something from five years ago. I mean, yeah, photos, you don't even remember taking posts that make you cringe, just your past self and bushing your present self. And so I guess that's what we have to do with now. Random reminders of our questionable fashion choices and old relationships. But whatever, at least it's entertaining in a sort of mortifying way. The whole DIY furniture trend is taking an interesting turn in my life. I mean, yeah, bought this desk online. One of those easy assembly things. But like three hours in, just sitting there surrounded by random pieces. Instructions that make it, might as well be ancient hieroglyphics. And so I know that's how my living room became this weird furniture of a graveyard, just parts everywhere. The funny thing started using this box that came in as a temporary desk. But whatever, maybe that's just a real DIY finding creative ways to avoid actual assembly. Hey, there fellow gamers ready to up your fortnight game.
