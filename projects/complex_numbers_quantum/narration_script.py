    "impossible_equation": "For over 2,000 years, mathematicians tried to solve the simplest-looking equation: x² + 1 = 0. But every attempt failed. Why? Because in the world of real numbers, no square can ever be negative. This tiny equation defied the greatest minds for centuries until finally the imaginary unit i was born, defined as √−1.",
    "new_dimension": "That invention didn't just solve an equation. It cracked open an entirely new dimension of mathematics. From that day forward, numbers were no longer just real. They became complex: a + bi, where a, b are real.",
    "fundamental_theorem": 'With complex numbers, mathematics became stronger. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra declared that every polynomial has a solution—but only inside the world of complex numbers. They transformed math from a puzzle into a universal language. And entire industries owe everything to this "imaginary" invention.',
    "applications": "Complex numbers fuel signal processing in your smartphone, secure communication in fiber optics, the design of power grids, the control of airplanes, and even earthquake-resistant skyscrapers. In short: no complex numbers, no modern technology.",
    "schrodinger": "But the real jaw-dropper came in 1926. Physicist Erwin Schrödinger was battling the mystery of electrons—tiny particles that refused to obey classical physics. They weren't orbiting like planets. They were rippling like waves. To describe them, Schrödinger unleashed his iconic wave equation, built on complex numbers: iħ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ",
    "wave_function": "Here, ψ is the electron's wave function. It's not real—it's complex. Only when you take the square of its magnitude, |ψ|², does it collapse into something real: the probability of finding an electron. Without complex numbers, quantum mechanics would never exist, and the atomic world would still be a mystery.",
