# GitHub Repository Description Update Required

## Current Description (Outdated)
The GitHub repository description currently includes:
> "synchronized ElevenLabs voiceover"

## Recommended New Description
Update the repository description to reflect the current Qwen voice clone technology:

**Option 1 (Simple):**
> "Automated Manim video production with local Qwen voice clone"

**Option 2 (Detailed):**
> "Automated Manim video production system with cached Qwen TTS voice clone - No network dependencies"

**Option 3 (Feature-focused):**
> "Incremental Manim video builder with local voice synthesis using Qwen TTS"

## How to Update

1. Go to https://github.com/zfifteen/flaming-horse
2. Click the **⚙️ Settings** gear icon (or navigate to Settings tab)
3. Find the **Description** field in the General section
4. Replace the current description with one of the options above (or your own version)
5. Click **Save** or the description will auto-save

## Why This Change?

The repository migrated from ElevenLabs to local Qwen voice clone in February 2026. The description should reflect the current technology stack to:

- Accurately inform contributors about the voice synthesis approach
- Avoid confusion about dependencies (no API keys needed)
- Highlight the "local-first" architecture advantage

## Related Changes
