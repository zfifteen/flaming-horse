# ManimMagic

Qualified name: `manim.utils.ipython\_magic.ManimMagic`

class ManimMagic(***kwargs*)[[source]](../_modules/manim/utils/ipython_magic.html#ManimMagic)
:   Bases: `Magics`

    Create a configurable given a config config.

    Parameters:
    :   - **config** (*Config*) – If this is empty, default values are used. If config is a
          `Config` instance, it will be used to configure the
          instance.
        - **parent** (*Configurable instance**,* *optional*) – The parent Configurable instance of this object.
        - **shell** (*InteractiveShell*)

    Notes

    Subclasses of Configurable must call the `__init__()` method of
    `Configurable` *before* doing anything else and using
    `super()`:

    ```python
    class MyConfigurable(Configurable):
        def __init__(self, config=None):
            super(MyConfigurable, self).__init__(config=config)
            # Then any other code you need to finish initialization.
    ```

    This ensures that instances will be configured properly.

    manim(*line*, *cell=None*, *local_ns=None*)[[source]](../_modules/manim/utils/ipython_magic.html#ManimMagic.manim)
    :   Render Manim scenes contained in IPython cells.
        Works as a line or cell magic.

        Hint

        This line and cell magic works best when used in a JupyterLab
        environment: while all of the functionality is available for
        classic Jupyter notebooks as well, it is possible that videos
        sometimes don’t update on repeated execution of the same cell
        if the scene name stays the same.

        This problem does not occur when using JupyterLab.

        Please refer to <https://jupyter.org/> for more information about JupyterLab
        and Jupyter notebooks.

        Usage in line mode:

        ```python
        %manim [CLI options] MyAwesomeScene
        ```

        Usage in cell mode:

        ```python
        %%manim [CLI options] MyAwesomeScene

        class MyAweseomeScene(Scene):
            def construct(self):
                ...
        ```

        Run `%manim --help` and `%manim render --help` for possible command line interface options.

        Note

        The maximal width of the rendered videos that are displayed in the notebook can be
        configured via the `media_width` configuration option. The default is set to `25vw`,
        which is 25% of your current viewport width. To allow the output to become as large
        as possible, set `config.media_width = "100%"`.

        The `media_embed` option will embed the image/video output in the notebook. This is
        generally undesirable as it makes the notebooks very large, but is required on some
        platforms (notably Google’s CoLab, where it is automatically enabled unless suppressed
        by `config.embed = False`) and needed in cases when the notebook (or converted HTML
        file) will be moved relative to the video locations. Use-cases include building
        documentation with Sphinx and JupyterBook. See also the [`manim directive for Sphinx`](manim.utils.docbuild.manim_directive.html#module-manim.utils.docbuild.manim_directive "manim.utils.docbuild.manim_directive").

        Examples

        First make sure to put `import manim`, or even `from manim import *`
        in a cell and evaluate it. Then, a typical Jupyter notebook cell for Manim
        could look as follows:

        ```python
        %%manim -v WARNING --disable_caching -qm BannerExample

        config.media_width = "75%"
        config.media_embed = True

        class BannerExample(Scene):
            def construct(self):
                self.camera.background_color = "#ece6e2"
                banner_large = ManimBanner(dark_theme=False).scale(0.7)
                self.play(banner_large.create())
                self.play(banner_large.expand())
        ```

        Evaluating this cell will render and display the `BannerExample` scene defined in the body of the cell.

        Note

        In case you want to hide the red box containing the output progress bar, the `progress_bar` config
        option should be set to `None`. This can also be done by passing `--progress_bar None` as a
        CLI flag.

        Parameters:
        :   - **line** (*str*)
            - **cell** (*str* *|* *None*)
            - **local_ns** (*dict**[**str**,* *Any**]* *|* *None*)

        Return type:
        :   None
