- Read all attached files from the `example/` directory before making any edits.
- Focus on extracting concrete scene coding patterns from `example/good/*` and anti-patterns from `example/bad/*`.
- Update only `training_ack.md` in the project directory.
- Do not create new files in this phase.
- Keep the acknowledgment concise and structured with these required sections:
  - `## Read Examples`
  - `## Scene Profile Mapping`
  - `## Motion Rules`
  - `## Do Rules`
  - `## Avoid Rules`
  - `## Acknowledgment`
- In `Read Examples`, list the filenames you reviewed.
- In `Scene Profile Mapping`, specify when to use `simple` vs `complex` profile (intro/recap vs middle scenes).
- In `Motion Rules`, include at least 5 concrete rules about pacing and transitions.
- In `Do Rules`, include 5 short, actionable rules you will follow in `build_scenes`.
- In `Avoid Rules`, include 5 short anti-patterns you will avoid in `build_scenes`.
- In `Read Examples`, include at least 2 files from `example/good/advanced/`.
- In `Acknowledgment`, include a single sentence promising to follow these rules in subsequent scene edits.
