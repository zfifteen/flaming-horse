    "scene_01_intro": """
Imagine you're presented with a choice. A simple one, really. Take the blue pill, and you slip back into the comfort of the life you know. Everything stays familiar, safe, and unchallenged. No questions, no disruptions—just the illusion you've always lived in.

But what if you choose the red pill? That's the path to truth. It's messy, uncertain, and it'll shake everything you think you know. Reality, raw and unfiltered, waits on the other side. Which will you pick?

    "scene_02_content": """
The Matrix isn't just a movie; it's a system. A digital cage that traps minds, feeding illusions to keep humanity asleep. It controls how we see the world, tying us to jobs, routines, and beliefs that serve its needs.

People are hooked—dependent on the system for their sense of purpose, even as it drains their potential. And when the truth starts to break through, resistance kicks in. We cling to the comfort of the lie because change is terrifying. But deep down, we know there's more.
""",

    "scene_03_conclusion": """
In the end, awakening isn't just about seeing the system—it's about freeing your own mind. We've all had that shared thought of resistance, that nagging feeling something's wrong. But true freedom? That's personal. You have to walk through that door yourself.

No one can do it for you. The journey starts with a single, bold step into the unknown. Are you ready to awaken?
