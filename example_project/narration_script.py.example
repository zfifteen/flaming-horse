    "intro": """
    Have you ever wondered why gravity isn't exactly the same everywhere on Earth?
    Some places pull just a tiny bit harder, while others pull a bit less.
    Today we're exploring gravity anomalies and how geophysicists measure them.
    Let's dive in!
    """,
    
    "bouguer_correction": """
    The Bouguer correction is one of the most important tools in gravity surveying.
    The formula is: Delta g B equals Delta g observed, minus 2 pi G rho h.
    Let's break down what each of these variables means.
    Delta g observed is the gravity we actually measure at a location.
    G is the gravitational constant, about 6.67 times 10 to the minus 11.
    Rho is the density of the terrain between the measurement point and sea level.
    And h is the elevation above sea level.
    This correction removes the effect of topography from our gravity measurements,
    giving us a clearer picture of what's happening deep underground.
    """,
    
    "applications": """
    So why do we care about gravity anomalies?
    In mineral exploration, negative anomalies can indicate less dense rock formations,
    which might contain valuable ore deposits or oil reservoirs.
    Positive anomalies might reveal dense intrusions or buried metallic bodies.
    In engineering, gravity surveys help us map underground cavities,
    old mine workings, or variations in bedrock depth before construction.
    Even archaeologists use gravity surveys to find buried structures
    without disturbing the ground!
    The applications are endless.
    """,
    
    "conclusion": """
    Let's recap what we've learned today.
    Gravity anomalies are variations in Earth's gravitational field
    caused by differences in subsurface density.
    The Bouguer correction removes the effect of elevation and terrain,
    isolating the signal we care about from deep underground.
    From finding mineral deposits to planning infrastructure projects,
    gravity surveying is a powerful, non-invasive tool.
