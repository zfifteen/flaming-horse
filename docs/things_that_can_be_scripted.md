# Opportunities for More Deterministic Video Production

**Analysis Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Purpose:** Identify tasks currently performed by the AI agent that could be "put on rails" via bash/python scripts to reduce variability and errors in rendered videos.

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the current workflow, I identified **7 high-value scripting opportunities** that would reduce agent decision-making and increase determinism. The current system already does a good job with `build_video.sh` orchestration and validation, but there are several areas where the agent is still making decisions that could be codified into scripts.

**Implementation Status: 2 of 7 complete** (✅ Scene scaffolding, ✅ scenes.txt generator)

---

## Current State Analysis

### What's Already Scripted (✅ Good)
1. **Project scaffolding** (`new_project.sh`) - Creates `project_state.json` with correct structure
2. **State machine orchestration** (`build_video.sh`) - Phase transitions, locking, backups
3. **Validation gates** (`validate_scene_imports`, `validate_voiceover_sync`) - Import naming, hardcoded text detection
4. **Quality control** (`qc_final_video.sh`) - Audio/video duration checks, silence detection
5. **Phase reset** (`reset_phase.sh`) - Manual recovery
6. **Scene file scaffolding** (`scaffold_scene.py`) - Generates boilerplate, leaves animation TODO
7. **scenes.txt generation** (`generate_scenes_txt.py`) - Automated ffmpeg concat file creation

### What the Agent Still Decides (⚠️ Opportunities)
1. Voice config file creation
2. Narration script file structure
3. Timing budget calculations
4. Pre-render validation (positioning, timing)
5. State file updates between phases

## High-Value Scripting Opportunities

### 1. Scene File Scaffolding Script ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Current Agent Task:**  
The agent generates complete scene `.py` files from scratch, including 60+ lines of boilerplate (imports, compatibility patch, config, helpers, class structure).

**Implemented Script:**  
`scripts/scaffold_scene.py` now generates the full scene boilerplate and leaves only a `# TODO: Add animations here` placeholder.

```bash
# Usage:
./scripts/scaffold_scene.py \
    --project projects/my_video \
    --scene-id scene_01_intro \
    --class-name Scene01Intro \
    --narration-key intro
```

**Script Output:** A valid `.py` file with:
- All imports (correct `manim_voiceover_plus` naming)
- Python 3.13 compatibility patch
- Locked config block
- `safe_position()` and `safe_layout()` helpers
- VoiceoverScene class with ElevenLabs setup
- A single `with self.voiceover(text=SCRIPT["intro"]) as tracker:` block ready for animations

**Why This Matters:**  
- Eliminates import naming mistakes (currently 10+ lines of validation in `build_video.sh`)
- Ensures consistency across all scenes
- Agent only needs to fill in the animation content

Optional overwrite flag:

```bash
./scripts/scaffold_scene.py \
    --project projects/my_video \
    --scene-id scene_01_intro \
    --class-name Scene01Intro \
    --narration-key intro \
    --force
```

**Implementation Status:** Completed (2026-02-13)

### 2. Voice Config Generator 🔥 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Current Agent Task:**  
The agent creates `voice_config.py` during the narration phase, which must contain specific locked values.

**What Can Be Scripted:**  
The `voice_config.py` file is 100% deterministic—always the same content. It should be generated by `new_project.sh` automatically.

```python
# scripts/generate_voice_config.py
# Or just add to new_project.sh:
cat > "$PROJECT_DIR/voice_config.py" <<'EOF'
"""
Voice configuration for ElevenLabs TTS
LOCKED - Do not modify
"""

from elevenlabs import VoiceSettings

VOICE_ID = "rBgRd5IfS6iqrGfuhlKR"
MODEL_ID = "eleven_multilingual_v2"

VOICE_SETTINGS = VoiceSettings(
    stability=0.5,
    similarity_boost=0.75,
    style=0.0,
    use_speaker_boost=True
)
EOF
```

**Why This Matters:**  
- Eliminates risk of wrong voice ID or model
- No agent decision required
- File is identical for every project

**Estimated Complexity:** Low (add 15 lines to `new_project.sh`)

---

### 3. Narration Script Scaffolding 📄 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Current Agent Task:**  
The agent creates `narration_script.py` with a `SCRIPT` dictionary containing keys matching `plan.json` scene IDs.

**What Can Be Scripted:**  
A script that reads `plan.json` and generates the `narration_script.py` skeleton with correct keys and placeholders.

```bash
# Proposed usage:
./scripts/scaffold_narration.py --project projects/my_video

# Reads plan.json, generates:
SCRIPT = {
    "intro": """# TODO: Write narration for 'What Are Gravity Anomalies?'
    # Target: ~75 words, ~30 seconds
    """,
    "bouguer_correction": """# TODO: Write narration for 'The Bouguer Correction'
    # Target: ~150 words, ~60 seconds
    """,
    ...
}
```

**Why This Matters:**  
- Keys always match `plan.json`
- Word count targets are embedded
- Agent only writes content, not structure

**Estimated Complexity:** Low (JSON parsing + template)

---

### 4. Timing Budget Validator 🕐 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Current Agent Task:**  
The agent must manually calculate that timing fractions sum to ≤1.0 within each `voiceover` block. This is error-prone and causes animation/audio desync.

**What Can Be Scripted:**  
A Python linter that parses scene files and validates timing budgets.

```bash
# Proposed usage:
./scripts/validate_timing.py projects/my_video/scene_01_intro.py

# Output:
✅ Scene01Intro: voiceover block 1 - timing total: 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.3 = 1.0 ✓
❌ Scene01Intro: voiceover block 2 - timing total: 0.6 + 0.5 = 1.1 > 1.0 OVERFLOW
   Line 45: run_time=tracker.duration * 0.6
   Line 48: run_time=tracker.duration * 0.5
```

**Implementation:**  
Use Python's `ast` module to parse the scene file and extract `tracker.duration * X` patterns, then sum them per voiceover block.

**Why This Matters:**  
- Prevents the most common cause of "dead air" in videos
- Can be added to `build_video.sh` as a gate before `final_render`
- Catches errors before expensive ElevenLabs API calls

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium (AST parsing)

---

### 5. scenes.txt Generator ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Previous Agent Task:**  
During `assemble` phase, the agent created `scenes.txt` with file paths for ffmpeg concatenation.

**Implemented Script:**  
`scripts/generate_scenes_txt.py` now handles this automatically by reading `project_state.json`.

```bash
# Usage:
python scripts/generate_scenes_txt.py projects/my_video

# Output: projects/my_video/scenes.txt
file 'media/videos/scene_01_intro/1440p60/Scene01Intro.mp4'
file 'media/videos/scene_02_demo/1440p60/Scene02Demo.mp4'
```

**Script Features:**
- Reads scene metadata from `project_state.json`
- Validates state structure before generation
- Supports both explicit `video_file` paths and default path construction
- Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages
- Generates ffmpeg-compatible concat file format

**Why This Matters:**  
- 100% deterministic output based on project state
- Agent doesn't need to make decisions about file paths
- Eliminates risk of malformed scenes.txt files
- Can be integrated into `build_video.sh` at start of `assemble` phase

**Testing:**
```bash
python scripts/test_generate_scenes_txt.py
# 13 tests covering all error cases and success paths
```

**Implementation Status:** Completed (2026-02-12)
**Documentation:** Updated in AGENTS.md assemble phase

---

### 6. Pre-Render Positioning Validator 📐 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Current Agent Task:**  
The agent is responsible for following positioning rules (use `UP * 3.8` not `.to_edge(UP)`, call `safe_position()` after `.next_to()`, etc.).

**What Can Be Scripted:**  
A linter that scans scene files for known anti-patterns.

```bash
# Proposed usage:
./scripts/lint_positioning.py projects/my_video/scene_01_intro.py

# Output:
⚠️  Line 42: .to_edge(UP) detected - use .move_to(UP * 3.8) for titles
⚠️  Line 56: .next_to() without safe_position() call
❌  Line 63: Multiple elements at ORIGIN without offsets
```

**Patterns to Detect:**
- `.to_edge(UP)` → suggest `.move_to(UP * 3.8)`
- `.next_to(...)` not followed by `safe_position()`
- Multiple `.move_to(ORIGIN)` calls without offsets
- Missing `safe_layout()` for VGroups with siblings

**Why This Matters:**  
- Prevents top-of-frame clipping (a real issue mentioned in docs)
- Catches overlap issues before rendering
- Complements existing `validate_voiceover_sync` check

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium (regex + AST analysis)

---

### 7. State Machine Advancement Script 🔄 **LOW PRIORITY**

**Current Agent Task:**  
The agent updates `project_state.json` to advance phases, update scene status, and log history entries.

**What Can Be Scripted:**  
State transition helpers that the agent calls instead of writing JSON directly.

```bash
# scripts/advance_phase.py
./scripts/advance_phase.py projects/my_video plan review

# scripts/mark_scene_built.py  
./scripts/mark_scene_built.py projects/my_video scene_01_intro

# scripts/mark_scene_rendered.py
./scripts/mark_scene_rendered.py projects/my_video scene_01_intro \
    --video-path media/videos/.../Scene01Intro.mp4
```

**Why This Matters:**  
- Reduces JSON manipulation errors
- Ensures consistent history logging
- Agent just calls command, doesn't write JSON

**Estimated Complexity:** Low (JSON manipulation)

---

| Priority | Script | Effort | Impact | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Voice Config Generator | Low | High (eliminates voice ID errors) | ⏳ Pending |

## What Should Remain Agent Tasks

Some tasks are inherently creative and should NOT be scripted:

1. **Plan generation** (`plan.json`) - Requires understanding the topic and breaking it into scenes
2. **Narration writing** - The actual prose content
3. **Animation design** - The creative visualization choices
4. **Review phase judgments** - Feasibility assessment requires reasoning

The goal is to give the agent **less boilerplate to write** and **more guardrails to operate within**, not to replace its creative function.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Adding New Validators to build_video.sh

New validation scripts should follow this pattern:

```bash
# In handle_build_scenes()
if ! ./scripts/validate_timing.py "$scene_file"; then
    echo "✗ Timing validation failed" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
    # Log error to state, return 1
fi
```

### Script Location

All new scripts should go in `/scripts/` directory and be executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/scaffold_scene.py
chmod +x scripts/generate_scenes_txt.py
chmod +x scripts/validate_timing.py
```

### Testing New Scripts

Before integrating, test against existing projects:

```bash
python scripts/test_scaffold_scene.py
python scripts/test_generate_scenes_txt.py
./scripts/validate_timing.py projects/parametric_resonance/scene_01_threshold_intro.py
./scripts/lint_positioning.py projects/parametric_resonance/scene_02_resonance_mechanism.py
```

---

## Conclusion

The current system is well-architected with good separation between orchestration (`build_video.sh`) and creative work (agent). The opportunities identified here focus on:

1. **Eliminating boilerplate** - Scene scaffolding ✅, voice config ⏳
2. **Catching errors earlier** - Timing validation ⏳, positioning linting ⏳
3. **Removing trivial decisions** - scenes.txt generation ✅, state updates ⏳

With 2 of 7 scripts implemented, the system has already gained significant determinism. Implementing priorities 2-4 (voice config, timing validator, narration scaffolding) would eliminate most remaining failure modes.
