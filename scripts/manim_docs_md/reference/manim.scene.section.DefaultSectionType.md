# DefaultSectionType

Qualified name: `manim.scene.section.DefaultSectionType`

class DefaultSectionType(**values*)[[source]](../_modules/manim/scene/section.html#DefaultSectionType)
:   Bases: `str`, `Enum`

    The type of a section can be used for third party applications.
    A presentation system could for example use the types to created loops.

    Examples

    This class can be reimplemented for more types:

    ```python
    class PresentationSectionType(str, Enum):
        # start, end, wait for continuation by user
        NORMAL = "presentation.normal"
        # start, end, immediately continue to next section
        SKIP = "presentation.skip"
        # start, end, restart, immediately continue to next section when continued by user
        LOOP = "presentation.loop"
        # start, end, restart, finish animation first when user continues
        COMPLETE_LOOP = "presentation.complete_loop"
    ```
