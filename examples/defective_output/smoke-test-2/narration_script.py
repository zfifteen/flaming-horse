    "scene_01_intro": """
Welcome to the real world. Imagine waking up from a dream that's been holding you captive your entire life. In this journey, we'll explore the boundary between illusion and truth, inspired by the iconic story of The Matrix. Are you ready to see beyond the veil?
""",
    
    "scene_02_content": """
The Matrix is everywhere. It surrounds us in our daily lives, from the window we look through to the television that entertains us. It's pulled over our eyes like a veil, blinding us to the deeper reality beneath. Think about it—work, taxes, the routines that define us—how much of that is truly real, and how much is just part of the simulation?
""",
    
    "scene_03_conclusion": """
Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This isn't something you can learn from a lecture or a book; it's a personal discovery, a choice to awaken. So, what's your path? Will you stay in the comfort of the known, or reach out and grasp the truth?
