        "Imagine a ball launched into the air. Its path is a parabola. "
        "One key question is: where does that curve cross the x-axis? "
        "Those crossing points are the real solutions of a quadratic equation. "
        "We need a reliable way to find them, even when factoring is hard. "
        "That is exactly what the quadratic formula gives us."
    ),
    "formula": (
        "For any quadratic written as ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero, "
        "the solutions are given by the quadratic formula. "
        "x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, "
        "all over two a."

    "components": (
        "Here is what each piece means. "
        "In ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero, a, b, and c are the coefficients. "
        "The discriminant, b squared minus four a c, tells us about the roots. "
        "If it is positive, we get two real solutions; if zero, one repeated solution; "
        "if negative, no real x intercepts. "
        "The plus or minus symbol means we take two values: one with plus, one with minus."
    ),
    "example": (
        "Let us solve x squared minus five x plus six equals zero. "
        "Here, a is one, b is negative five, and c is six. "
        "Substitute into the formula: x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over two a. "
        "That becomes x equals five plus or minus the square root of twenty five minus twenty four, over two. "
        "The discriminant is one, so the square root is one. "
        "Now split the plus and minus. "
        "x equals five plus one over two gives three. "
        "x equals five minus one over two gives two. "
        "Check: three squared minus five times three plus six is nine minus fifteen plus six, zero. "
        "And two squared minus five times two plus six is four minus ten plus six, zero."
    ),
    "closing": (
        "On the graph, the parabola for x squared minus five x plus six crosses the x-axis at x equals two and x equals three. "
        "Those intercepts are exactly the two solutions from the quadratic formula."
