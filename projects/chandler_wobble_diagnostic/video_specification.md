# Video Specification: Chandler Wobble as Core-Mantle Coupling Diagnostic

## Narration Script (VERBATIM - Use Exactly As Written)

### Full Narration Text:

The Chandler wobble's 180-degree phase reversal upon reappearance in 2021 is not merely a symptom of excitation collapse — it is a direct signature that the Earth's core-mantle system crossed a coupling-regime boundary, and the specific phase inversion predicts that the 6-year length-of-day oscillation will also exhibit a half-cycle phase shift detectable by 2027.

The standard explanation treats the Chandler wobble disappearance as a statistical fluke where random atmospheric and oceanic forcing happened to cancel out. But random cancellation cannot produce a clean 180-degree phase flip upon reappearance — randomness would produce a random new phase.

A precise half-cycle inversion is the hallmark of a system that passed through a node in a modulated envelope, meaning something with a longer period is amplitude-modulating the Chandler wobble. That modulator must share a coupling pathway with the core.

The 6-year LOD oscillation, driven by torsional Alfven waves at the core-mantle boundary, already showed an anomalous "interruption" during 2010-2014. If the same coupling-regime shift that killed and phase-inverted the Chandler wobble also perturbed the 6-year signal, the two disruptions should be temporally offset by the difference in their resonant response times — roughly 5 to 7 years.

This means the 6-year LOD oscillation, when it fully re-establishes after the 2010-2014 interruption, should show its own phase offset relative to pre-2010 behavior. Not necessarily a full 180-degree flip, but a measurable shift in the phase relationship between LOD and atmospheric angular momentum.

The non-obvious implication is that Chandler wobble phase reversals are not 90-year random events — they are leading indicators of core-mantle coupling regime transitions, arriving years before the same transition propagates into the LOD signal and subsequently into climate-relevant angular momentum transfer.

If correct, monitoring Chandler wobble phase stability becomes a predictive tool for anticipating disruptions in the 6-year climate-linked oscillation, with a lead time of approximately half a decade.

### Scene 3: Modulated Envelope Signature (28s)
**Narration segment**: "A precise half-cycle inversion... core dynamics."

**Animations**:
- Fast sinusoidal wave (433-day Chandler period)

- Wave approaches envelope zero-crossing node
- At node, fast oscillation inverts phase
- Zoom out showing envelope connected to Earth core-mantle boundary

### Scene 4: The 6-Year LOD Connection (35s)
**Narration segment**: "The 6-year LOD oscillation... roughly 5 to 7 years."

**Animations**:
- Split screen: Chandler Wobble (433-day) vs. 6-Year LOD waves
- Earth cross-section with torsional Alfven waves from core
- Timeline 2010-2027 appears
- Highlight 2010-2014 disruption on LOD wave (red, jagged)

- Dotted projection to 2027 with question mark

### Scene 5: The Prediction (32s)
**Narration segment**: "This means the 6-year LOD oscillation... atmospheric angular momentum."

**Animations**:
- Two overlaid sine waves: Pre-2010 (blue solid) vs. Post-2027 (cyan dashed)
- Initially in phase, then cyan wave shifts 30-90° horizontally
- Below: correlation plot showing anti-phase correlation (r=-0.6)
- Correlation weakens (scatter increases, r drops to -0.3)
- Text: "Falsifiable Prediction: Phase offset detectable by late 2027"

### Scene 6: Paradigm Shift (30s)
**Narration segment**: "The non-obvious implication... angular momentum transfer."

**Animations**:
- Three vertical panels: "Core-Mantle Boundary" | "Chandler Wobble" | "6-Year LOD → Climate"
- Pulsing orange glow at CMB, wave pulse emanates
- Wave reaches CW panel first (2019-2021), spiral flips
- Wave continues to LOD panel (2026-2027), wave distorts
- Arrow connects all: "Leading Indicator: ~5-7 year advance warning"

### Scene 7: Practical Utility (20s)
**Narration segment**: "If correct, monitoring Chandler wobble... half a decade."

**Animations**:
- Earth globe + monitoring dashboard
- Dashboard shows "Chandler Wobble Phase Monitor" with live trace
- Phase angle shifts (0° → 90° → 180°), triggers yellow alert
- "Coupling Regime Transition Detected"
- Timeline projection: "Predicted 6-Year LOD Disruption: 2026-2028"

### Scene 8: Conclusion (15s)
**Narration**: [Silent - 2-3 second pause]

**Animations**:
- Title card reappears with subtitle "A Falsifiable Prediction"
- Three bullet points fade in:
  - ✓ Mechanism: Shared core-mantle coupling pathway
  - ✓ Prediction: LOD phase offset by 2027
  - ✓ Disconfirmation: No phase offset → hypothesis falsified
- Final text: "Watch this space. The core-mantle system is speaking."
- Fade to black
