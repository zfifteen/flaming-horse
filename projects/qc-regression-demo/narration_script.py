SCRIPT = {
    "intro": """Welcome to the QC Regression Pipeline Demo. 
[Beat 1: Hook] In quality control, detecting regressions quickly can save your project from disaster. 
[Beat 2: Overview] Today, we'll demo a streamlined pipeline: from raw data to predictive insights using linear regression. 
[Beat 3: Teaser] Let's dive in.""",

    "data_overview": """[Beat 1: Introduce data] First, our sample QC dataset. 
[Beat 2: Table] Here's the table: batch ID, size, defect rate, timestamp. 
[Beat 3: Viz] Visualized as a bar chart, trends pop—spikes in defects correlate with larger batches. 
[Beat 4: Transition] Perfect setup for modeling.""",

    "regression_analysis": """[Beat 1: Model intro] Now, linear regression time. 
[Beat 2: Scatter] Scatter plot: batch size vs. defect rate. 
[Beat 3: Fit line] Best-fit line appears, capturing the upward trend. 
[Beat 4: Predictions] Predictions highlighted—close to actuals, with residuals shown for accuracy.""",

    "results": """[Beat 1: Metrics] Results: R-squared 0.85—strong fit! 
[Beat 2: RMSE] RMSE just 0.12, minimal errors. 
[Beat 3: Compare] Comparison table: beats naive baselines by 30%. 
[Beat 4: Value] Reliable predictions for proactive QC.""",

    "conclusion": """[Beat 1: Recap] Recap: data overview, regression model, stellar metrics. 
[Beat 2: Benefits] This pipeline automates regression detection in QC. 
[Beat 3: CTA] Integrate it today—thanks for watching!"""
