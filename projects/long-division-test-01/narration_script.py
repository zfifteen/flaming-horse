    "intro": """Imagine you're sharing 12,345 candies equally among 23 friends. Counting them out one by one would take ages! Enter long division: the efficient way to tackle big divisions step by step. Today, we'll break it down from the ground up, so you can master it too.""",
    
    "components": """Every long division starts with four main players: the dividend, the big number inside the bracket, like 12345; the divisor outside, say 23; the quotient on top, showing how many times it divides evenly; and the remainder, any leftovers at the end. Think of the bracket as a fortress protecting the dividend from the divisor.""",
    
    "step1": """Step one: look at the divisor and the first digits of the dividend big enough to divide into. 23 goes into 123 how many times? Five, because 23 times 5 equals 115. Write 5 above the 3. Multiply 23 by 5 to get 115 under 123, then subtract: 123 minus 115 leaves 8.""",
    
    "step2": """Bring down the next digit, 4, making 84. 23 into 84? Three times, 23 times 3 is 69. Subtract 84 minus 69 equals 15. Bring down 5, now 155. 23 into 155 is six times exactly, 23 times 6 is 138. Subtract, remainder 17. Repeat: bring down, divide, multiply, subtract!""",
    
    "example": """Full example: 12345 divided by 23. First partial: 123 / 23 = 5, 5*23=115, subtract →8. Bring 4 →84 /23=3, 3*23=69, subtract→15. Bring 5→155/23=6, 6*23=138, subtract→17 remainder. Quotient 536. Verify: 23*536=12328 +17=12345. Spot on!""",
    
    "recap": """Long division recap: setup bracket, divide into partial dividend, multiply, subtract, bring down, repeat. Common pitfalls: forgetting to bring down, or misplacing quotient digits. Practice daily, check your math, and soon it'll be second nature. Thanks for watching—now go divide!"""
