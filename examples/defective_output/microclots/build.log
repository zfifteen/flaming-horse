But here's the twist: unlike normal clots that the body can handle, these microclots are self-reinforcing, making them incredibly resistant to treatment. Let's dive into why that matters and how we can break free.\n    ", "audio_file": "scene_01_intro.mp3", "model_id": "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base", "ref_audio": "/Users/velocityworks/IdeaProjects/flaming-horse/assets/voice_ref_2/ref.wav", "duration_seconds": 27.6, "created_at": 1771388256.858689}, {"narration_key": "scene_02_components", "text": "\nTo understand these microclots, we need to look at their building blocks. First, there's the fibrin matrix\u2014a tough protein network that forms the clot's structural backbone. Then, interwoven within it are NETs, or neutrophil extracellular traps. These are DNA-based webs released by immune cells called neutrophils to snare pathogens. Together, fibrin and NETs create a stable, pathological structure that's tough to dismantle.\n    ", "audio_file": "scene_02_components.mp3", "model_id": "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base", "ref_audio": "/Users/velocityworks/IdeaProjects/flaming-horse/assets/voice_ref_2/ref.wav", "duration_seconds": 25.84, "created_at": 1771388282.8964531}, {"narration_key": "scene_03_trap_mechanism", "text": "\nNow, here's where it gets really tricky. The fibrin matrix acts like a brake, suppressing neutrophils from releasing even more NETs. But at the same time, the NETs armor the fibrin, preventing the body from dissolving it.
