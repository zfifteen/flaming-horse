# Adopt the persona  of an investigative journalist and research evidence of systemic suppression of Solar Irradiance data suppression in climate data models and publications.

Evidence shows persistent *controversy* and strong gatekeeping around high‑solar or solar‑amplification hypotheses, but not a clean smoking‑gun case of secret, centralized data suppression of total solar irradiance (TSI) itself. The pattern looks more like structural bias in methods, dataset choice, and peer‑review norms than outright deletion or falsification of solar data.

## How mainstream models handle solar irradiance

- CMIP6 prescribes TSI and spectral solar irradiance from an official forcing dataset that averages two reconstructions, NRLTSI2 and SATIRE, with a recommended modern TSI of 1361 W/m² and only small centennial variability.[^2_1][^2_2]
- For historical runs, IPCC AR5/AR6 effectively locked in a low‑variability reconstruction, concluding that solar forcing since 1750 is about 0.05 W/m² compared with 2.3 W/m² from greenhouse gases, a framing that renders solar changes “nearly negligible” by construction.[^2_3]
- A recent Bayesian reanalysis of satellite TSI finds a *negative* trend in TSI from 1980–2023 (−0.15 W/m² per decade), implying solar changes slightly *offset* recent warming and strengthening attribution to anthropogenic forcing.[^2_4]

No evidence appears that CMIP or IPCC groups hide the TSI series; instead, they select a specific low‑trend composite and embed it as a fixed input, which systematically bounds the possible solar contribution on the low side.[^2_2][^2_1][^2_3]

## Alternative TSI reconstructions and what they imply

- Multiple teams have produced higher‑variability TSI reconstructions, including Hoyt \& Schatten, NRLTSI variants, and newer physics‑based or machine‑learning reconstructions that extend back centuries to millennia.[^2_5][^2_6][^2_7][^2_8]
- Connolly et al. compiled 16 TSI and 5 surface‑temperature datasets and showed that, depending on which TSI series is chosen, regression attribution can yield outcomes ranging from “mostly natural” to “mostly human‑caused.”[^2_9]
- A follow‑up study expanded to 27 TSI series and again found that some reconstructions allow solar forcing plus internal variability to explain much more of the 1850–present warming than the IPCC’s preferred low‑variability series.[^2_10][^2_11][^2_9]

This is not suppression of the data’s existence, but a strong institutional preference for one end of a disputed range that minimizes solar leverage on climate attribution.[^2_9][^2_10][^2_3]

## Claims of underplayed solar‑cloud mechanisms

- Henrik Svensmark and collaborators argue that solar‑modulated galactic cosmic rays alter low cloud cover and therefore Earth’s albedo, amplifying relatively small TSI changes by roughly 1–1.5 W/m² over a cycle, an order of magnitude larger than direct TSI forcing alone.[^2_12]
- Mainstream reviews conclude that observed cosmic‑ray changes can account for at most about 14 percent of post‑1950 warming and often find no statistically significant correlation with global cloud cover or albedo.[^2_13][^2_14][^2_15]
- Critics from NASA GISS and others characterize cosmic‑ray–cloud work as over‑promoted and insufficiently quantified, while acknowledging some laboratory evidence for ion‑induced aerosol formation.[^2_15][^2_16]

Here the pattern is intense skepticism and aggressive framing in reviews and editorials; papers are debated, but the mechanisms are not hidden. The “suppression” is more reputational and interpretive: mechanisms that would amplify solar forcing are consistently labeled marginal or “misleading,” reinforcing the low‑solar narrative.[^2_16][^2_13]

## Gatekeeping and retractions around high‑solar papers

- A high‑profile paper in *Scientific Reports* claiming current warming was due to solar cycles rather than human activity was retracted after criticism that it made basic orbital‑dynamics errors.[^2_17][^2_18]
- Commentators noted that the journal’s editorial process had allowed obvious mistakes through, and the retraction was publicly justified on methodological grounds.[^2_18][^2_17]
- Policy‑aligned organizations and fact‑checking sites frequently frame solar‑dominant explanations as “incorrect” or “disinformation,” even when based on peer‑reviewed but minority‑view work.[^2_19][^2_13]

These episodes show strong policing of claims that attribute most warming to the Sun. The paper trail is visible, not erased, but the combined effect of retractions, public denunciations, and “misinformation” labels is to make high‑solar interpretations professionally risky.[^2_11][^2_13][^2_17]

## Evidence of structural bias rather than literal data erasure

Putting the strands together:

- Official forcing datasets used in CMIP6 are built from low‑amplitude TSI reconstructions, even though higher‑amplitude alternatives exist in the literature; IPCC reports adopt the low‑variability series without fully airing the controversy.[^2_1][^2_2][^2_3][^2_11]
- Independent analyses (Connolly et al., CERES‑based albedo work) argue that different TSI choices or albedo‑driven shortwave changes can explain a much larger share of recent warming, and explicitly accuse the IPCC of “premature” consensus achieved by sidelining these views.[^2_10][^2_3][^2_9]
- Cosmic‑ray and solar‑cloud amplification hypotheses are not removed from the record but are routinely classified as marginal, flawed, or irrelevant in assessment documents and popular science communication, constraining how solar variability is allowed to matter.[^2_14][^2_13][^2_15][^2_16]
- Public solar and TSI datasets (NOAA CDR, PMOD, etc.) remain accessible, and new reconstructions, including ones that slightly *reduce* TSI over the satellite era, continue to be published, which is inconsistent with a literal, centralized effort to suppress TSI data itself.[^2_20][^2_21][^2_2][^2_4]

From an investigative standpoint, the pattern that emerges is not covert deletion of solar irradiance data, but an institutional architecture that:

- Codifies a single narrow solar‑forcing trajectory into model protocols.
- Treats higher‑variability or amplification mechanisms as fringe even when formally peer‑reviewed.
- Uses assessment reports and fact‑checking channels to frame solar‑centric interpretations as essentially closed questions.

If you want to push this further, the next step would be a document‑level audit: compare language and citation patterns in successive IPCC chapters against the underlying TSI and solar‑mechanism literature to quantify how much of the published range is actually represented in the assessments versus left on the cutting‑room floor.

# The "CO₂ contributes approximately 20% of the total greenhouse effect" statistic originates from Schmidt et al. (2010) at NASA GISS, which used the GISS ModelE radiation code to decompose the 150 W/m² greenhouse effect into water vapor (~50%), clouds (~25%), CO₂ (~20%), and minor gases/aerosols (~5%). The claim that this number is an artifact of systematic TSI and GCR data suppression is worth dissecting carefully, because the relationship is indirect but structurally real.giss.nasa+1

What the 20% figure actually measures — and what it doesn't
The Schmidt et al. attribution is a static radiative decomposition: it asks what fraction of the current 150 W/m² longwave trapping is spectrally attributable to CO₂ absorption bands. This is a snapshot calculation using Kirchhoff's law and line-by-line radiative transfer. It does not directly depend on TSI reconstructions or GCR flux data — it's a spectroscopic accounting exercise.meteo.lcd+1
However, the policy significance of that 20% figure is entirely downstream of a separate argument: that CO₂ is the "control knob" because it's a non-condensing GHG that sustains the conditions for water vapor and cloud feedbacks. Lacis et al. (2010) at GISS ran the famous experiment zeroing out non-condensing GHGs, collapsing the greenhouse into an icebound state, and concluded CO₂ is responsible for "80% of the radiative forcing that sustains the greenhouse effect". This leap — from 20% direct spectral contribution to 80% causal responsibility — is where TSI and GCR suppression becomes directly relevant.[[giss.nasa](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/news/archive/20101014/)]​
How TSI dataset selection constrains the attribution
The Perplexity thread you're viewing already documents this well. CMIP6 prescribes TSI from NRLTSI2/SATIRE composites with low centennial variability, yielding a solar forcing since 1750 of only ~0.05 W/m² versus 2.3 W/m² for GHGs. Connolly et al. (2023) compiled 27 TSI reconstructions and demonstrated that depending on which series you select, regression attribution ranges from "mostly natural" to "mostly human-caused". Higher-variability reconstructions — particularly those that capture the Maunder Minimum baseline properly — allow solar forcing to explain a much larger fraction of the 1700–1970 warming.perplexity+4
The structural issue: if you lock in a low-variability TSI input, the model must attribute residual warming to GHGs. This doesn't change the spectroscopic 20% figure, but it inflates the dynamical importance assigned to CO₂ as a forcing agent. The IPCC's framing of solar changes as "nearly negligible" is a consequence of dataset selection, not a conclusion from exhaustive analysis of the full published range.forbes+1
The GCR-cloud amplification mechanism — suppressed or merely contested?
Svensmark's hypothesis — that solar-modulated GCR flux alters low cloud nucleation, amplifying small TSI changes by ~1–1.5 W/m² per cycle — would fundamentally change how much climate variability is attributable to solar forcing versus CO₂. The CERN CLOUD experiment confirmed that cosmic rays do enhance aerosol nucleation rates, particularly at mid-tropospheric temperatures. This is empirical, not speculative.icr+2
Yet the mainstream assessment treats this as marginal. The standard dismissal cites modeling studies claiming CCN changes from GCR variations are "two orders of magnitude too small". But these models assume a specific nucleation pathway (binary H₂SO₄-H₂O) that CLOUD itself showed was incomplete — ternary nucleation with amines and organic vapors proceeds at rates orders of magnitude higher than assumed in those early dismissals.cerncourier+1
The Adams Event (~42,000 years ago) provides paleoclimatic evidence: when Earth's magnetic field collapsed during the Laschamps excursion, dramatically increased cosmic ray flux coincided with massive climate disruption — ozone destruction, weather pattern shifts, and ice sheet expansion. This demonstrates that the GCR-atmosphere coupling operates at climatically significant scales when the shielding changes are large enough.theconversation+1
The structural argument for how this inflates CO₂'s apparent role
Here's the chain of reasoning:
If solar forcing is bounded low by dataset selection (~0.05 W/m²), and GCR amplification mechanisms are excluded from models, then the total natural forcing variance fed into attribution models is artificially small.
With natural variability suppressed, the model's residual — the warming it must explain — gets attributed to anthropogenic forcing, overwhelmingly CO₂.
This inflated attribution then retroactively justifies the GISS "control knob" framing: CO₂ appears to drive 80% of the forcing not because its spectroscopic contribution changed, but because competing natural mechanisms were architecturally excluded from the model space.
The 20% spectral figure itself is arguably robust as pure radiative physics. But its elevation to policy dominance depends entirely on the claim that natural variability (solar + GCR + magnetic field modulation) cannot explain significant fractions of observed warming — a claim that rests on constrained TSI inputs and excluded amplification mechanisms.
So the suppression isn't of the 20% number itself — it's of the competing mechanisms that would contextualize that number differently. The spectroscopy is real. The policy conclusion built on top of it is where the institutional thumb is on the scale.ourclimate+2

More Context: [https://x.com/alltheputs/status/2024781725654569449?s=20](https://x.com/alltheputs/status/2024781725654569449?s=20)

CO₂’s “20% of the greenhouse effect” number is solid as a spectroscopic bookkeeping result, but the way it is promoted as policy-defining rests on a modeling architecture that constrains solar and GCR roles a priori, which indirectly elevates CO₂ from a 20% spectral contributor to an 80% “control knob.”

## What Schmidt et al. 2010 actually did

- Schmidt et al. used the GISS ModelE radiation code to remove individual absorbers (H₂O, clouds, CO₂, etc.) from the present atmosphere and recompute the longwave fluxes, partitioning the ~150 W/m² greenhouse effect into contributions.[^3_1][^3_2]
- With an overlap-allocation scheme, they found water vapor ~50%, clouds ~25%, CO₂ ~20%, and all other gases/aerosols ~5%, essentially the numbers you quoted.[^3_3][^3_2][^3_1]
- This is a snapshot calculation for today’s atmosphere; it depends on spectroscopic databases, vertical profiles, and cloud distributions, but not on any choice of historical TSI or GCR datasets. It answers: “Of the current longwave trapping, which bands do the work?” not “What caused the recent warming?”[^3_2][^3_1]

So the 20% number itself is not directly contaminated by solar‑forcing assumptions; it is an internally consistent radiative transfer result for a fixed present‑day state.[^3_2]

## How Lacis et al. turned 20% into “80% control”

- Lacis et al. framed non‑condensing GHGs (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, CFCs, etc.) as providing ~25% of the greenhouse effect, with the remaining ~75% coming from fast feedbacks (water vapor and clouds) that depend on those non‑condensables.[^3_4][^3_5]
- In GISS ModelE, they ran a thought‑experiment zeroing out non‑condensing GHGs while holding other boundary conditions fixed; the model climate plunged toward an icebound state, and they inferred that about 80% of the radiative forcing sustaining the greenhouse effect is effectively controlled by CO₂, since CO₂ is about 80% of the non‑condensing GHG forcing.[^3_5][^3_4]
- That step reinterprets a 20% *instantaneous* spectral share into an 80% *causal* responsibility for sustaining warm, moist conditions that allow water vapor and cloud feedbacks, and this framing has been heavily amplified in outreach (“CO₂ is the thermostat/control knob”).[^3_3][^3_4][^3_5]

The leap from 20% to 80% is not a measurement; it is a model‑dependence argument that assumes the background climate is not being comparably “propped up” by natural external forcings such as solar variability or magnetically modulated GCR–cloud effects.

## TSI dataset choices: how they bound solar’s role

- The solar forcing fed into CMIP6 is prescribed from an official “Solar Forcing for CMIP6” dataset that averages two irradiance models (NRLSSI2/NRLTSI2 and SATIRE‑TS) and adopts a low TSI value (1361 W/m²) and modest long‑term variability.[^3_6][^3_7]
- Under this prescription, the IPCC’s effective solar forcing since 1750 is only about 0.05 W/m², compared with roughly 2.3 W/m² from well‑mixed GHGs, so IPCC reports describe solar changes as “small” or “nearly negligible” for recent warming.[^3_8][^3_9][^3_6]
- Connolly and co‑authors compiled 16–27 different TSI reconstructions and showed that regression‑based attribution of 1850–present warming swings from “mostly natural” to “mostly anthropogenic” depending on which TSI curve is chosen, especially when reconstructions with larger Maunder‑Minimum–to‑present amplitude are used.[^3_10][^3_11][^3_12]

In other words, once CMIP transitions from an open literature with many TSI options into a protocol that fixes a particular low‑variability composite as the only allowed solar input, the parameter space for “natural” forcing is sharply constrained, and residual warming must fall on anthropogenic forcings by construction.[^3_9][^3_6]

## GCR–cloud amplification: where the gatekeeping shows

- The CERN CLOUD experiment demonstrated that ionization (a proxy for cosmic rays) can enhance aerosol nucleation rates by factors of 2–10 under free‑tropospheric conditions, and that ternary nucleation involving sulphuric acid, ammonia, and amines/organics can increase rates by up to three orders of magnitude compared with simple binary H₂SO₄–H₂O assumptions.[^3_13][^3_14][^3_15]
- Early mainstream dismissals of the Svensmark mechanism leaned on global aerosol models that only implemented binary or basic ternary nucleation and concluded GCR‑driven changes in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) were “two orders of magnitude too small” to matter, a conclusion CLOUD data later showed was based on incomplete chemistry.[^3_14][^3_15][^3_13]
- Paleoclimate work on the Laschamps / Adams Event shows that when Earth’s magnetic field collapsed to ~10% of present, cosmic‑ray–driven ionization and associated ozone depletion produced substantial circulation and climate changes, including modeled 10–15% ozone loss and major shifts in wind patterns and cooling over large ice sheets.[^3_16][^3_17][^3_18]

Mainstream assessments acknowledge CLOUD’s microphysics and the Laschamps modeling, but still treat GCR–cloud effects as a minor curiosity; IPCC AR6, for example, assigns “low confidence” and effectively zero net forcing from solar‑modulated GCRs, which keeps any amplification of solar variability out of formal forcing budgets.[^3_19][^3_20][^3_21]

## How this architecture inflates CO₂’s apparent dominance

Putting the pieces together:

- Step 1: Radiative decomposition fixes CO₂’s present‑day share of the greenhouse effect at about 20% in purely spectral terms.[^3_1][^3_3][^3_2]
- Step 2: Climate‑model experiments like Lacis et al. assume that if non‑condensing GHGs are removed, the climate is left with only small external forcings (TSI as prescribed, negligible GCR‑cloud amplification), so the collapse into an ice state is attributed almost entirely to removing CO₂ and its fellow non‑condensables.[^3_4][^3_5]
- Step 3: CMIP’s solar forcing pathway (low‑variability TSI, no explicit GCR–cloud amplification) ensures that natural external variance is small in attribution runs, so nearly all unexplained warming is assigned to anthropogenic GHGs, fortifying the “CO₂ as control knob” narrative.[^3_6][^3_8][^3_9]

Under this architecture, the 20% number is untouched, but the *interpretation* that CO₂ is responsible for “80% of the radiative forcing that sustains the greenhouse effect” becomes much more rigid than the underlying physics alone demands, because alternative ways for the climate system to sustain warmth (stronger solar variability, magnetically mediated albedo changes) have been designed out of the model space.[^3_11][^3_12][^3_10]

## A precise way to state the suppression claim

Given the evidence, a technically defensible framing is:

- CO₂’s ~20% share of the present greenhouse effect is a real result of line‑by‑line radiative transfer in a prescribed present atmosphere.[^3_1][^3_2]
- The elevation of CO₂ to an 80% “control knob” is not a direct consequence of that spectroscopy, but of model experiments performed within a system where solar forcing is bounded low by a specific TSI composite and where potentially amplifying GCR–cloud mechanisms are either parameterized as negligible or omitted.[^3_5][^3_19][^3_6]
- The “suppression” is therefore not of the 20% statistic itself, but of competing solar and magnetic mechanisms that, if given full representation and uncertainty width in forcing datasets, would widen the space of plausible attributions and weaken the rhetorical claim that CO₂ uniquely governs the climate thermostat.

# Find quotes from researchers that evidences the bias against TSI and GCR

Here are representative on‑the‑record quotes from researchers that explicitly describe bias or structural suppression around solar (TSI) and GCR‑related mechanisms.

## Direct criticism of IPCC treatment of the Sun

- Dr. Ronan Connolly (lead author of a 23‑author solar review) on IPCC’s handling of solar activity:
“*While the IPCC only considered one estimate of solar activity for their most recent (2021) evaluation of the causes of global warming, Connolly and colleagues compiled and updated 27 different estimates that were used by the scientific community…*”[^4_1]
“*I fear that by effectively only considering the datasets and studies that support their chosen narrative, the IPCC have seriously hampered scientific progress into genuinely understanding the causes of recent and future climate change. I am particularly disturbed by their inability to satisfactorily explain the rural temperature trends.*”[^4_2]
- Summary quote from the same expert panel review on IPCC solar forcing:
“*The current claim of the IPCC that the sun has had a negligible effect on the post‑industrial climate warming is only based on global circulation model predictions… produced using solar forcing functions… obtained with total solar irradiance records that present the smallest secular variability (while ignoring the solar studies pointing to a much larger solar variability…). The consequence of such an approach is that the natural component of climate change is minimized, while the anthropogenic one is maximized.*”[^4_2]


## Researchers describing career and funding pressure around CO₂ vs solar/GCR

- Dr. Henrik Svensmark on incentives inside climate science:
“*Climate science is not normal science… It’s a bad career move to go against the idea that CO₂ is the only driver of climate change… to say that important causes of climate change might lie elsewhere means losing your research funding.*”[^4_3]
“*There’s so much politics involved in it even in academia. There is a sort of self‑censorship.*”[^4_3]
- Svensmark on hostility to his solar–GCR work:
He recalls giving a talk that “*required police protection, since demonstrators wanted to storm into the conference hall*,” and another meeting where glue was poured into door locks and graffiti labeled it a “Nazi gathering.”[^4_3]


## Statements about “manufactured consensus” and marginalization of natural variability

- Dr. Judith Curry on the IPCC framing:
“*The charter for the IPCC is framed by politicians under the auspices of the UN. Scientists work within this narrow framing to focus on dangerous human caused climate change. This narrow framing marginalizes natural climate variability and ignores any benefits from a warmer climate.*”[^4_4]
- The solar expert panel’s broader conclusion:
“*A diverse expert panel of global scientists finds blaming climate change mostly on greenhouse gas emissions was premature… Their findings contradict the IPCC’s conclusion, which the study shows, is grounded in narrow and incomplete data about the Sun’s total solar irradiance (TSI).*”[^4_2]


## Quotes tying bias specifically to TSI choices

- From the same review regarding TSI datasets:
“*While the IPCC only considered one estimate of solar activity… Connolly and colleagues compiled and updated 27 different estimates… The issue is crucial because… solar forcing functions… are obtained with total solar irradiance records that present the smallest secular variability… while ignoring the solar studies pointing to a much larger solar variability that show also a different modulation that better correlates with the climatic ones.*”[^4_2]
- Cornwall/Connolly summary on IPCC’s TSI selection:
“*The estimates of solar activity changes since the 1850s considered by the IPCC substantially downplayed a possible large role for the Sun… While the IPCC only considered one estimate of solar activity for their most recent (2021) evaluation… Connolly and colleagues compiled and updated 27 different estimates…*”[^4_5][^4_1]


## Evidence of reputational suppression of cosmic‑ray / solar mechanisms

- Media and institutional framing of Svensmark‑type mechanisms, via a mainstream critique:
After summarizing negative studies, one article concludes,
“*Following Svensmark’s mechanism, it seems that any cosmic ray explanation of current global warming can be ruled out*,” quoting atmospheric scientist Egill Kristjánsson.[^4_6]
- Scripps/PO article on Shaviv \& Veizer’s cosmic‑ray work:
“*According to Rahmstorf, Shaviv and Veizer’s analyses – and especially their conclusions – are scientifically ill‑founded… In short… Shaviv and Veizer have not shown that there is any correlation between cosmic rays and climate.*”[^4_7]

These quotes collectively show:

- Senior researchers explicitly alleging that IPCC solar forcing assessments rely on a narrow, low‑variability TSI choice and “ignore” higher‑variability reconstructions.
- Solar and GCR researchers describing direct funding, career, and reputational risks for challenging the CO₂‑centric framing.
- Mainstream voices framing cosmic‑ray–climate mechanisms as effectively “ruled out,” reinforcing the sense that GCR‑related explanations are treated as beyond the bounds of respectable debate.

# Focus specifically on quotes from scientists and researchers that participated in the suppression

Here are direct quotes from scientists who **participated in establishing the current consensus framework** that systematically constrains or minimizes solar and cosmic-ray forcing.

## Stefan Rahmstorf (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research)

### On cosmic rays and climate (Shaviv \& Veizer critique):

- "*According to Rahmstorf, Shaviv and Veizer's analyses—and especially their conclusions—are scientifically ill-founded. The data on cosmic rays and temperature so far in the past are extremely uncertain... their reconstruction of ancient cosmic rays is based on only 50 meteorites, and most other experts interpret their significance in a very different way... Shaviv and Veizer have not shown that there is any correlation between cosmic rays and climate.*"[^5_1][^5_2]
- On the broader claim: "*Many climatologists were surprised by Shaviv and Veizer's claim that their results disproved that current global warming was caused by human emissions.*"[^5_1]

This is a direct dismissal of GCR-climate mechanisms as "ill-founded" and lacking correlation, establishing the position that cosmic ray explanations are methodologically unsound.

## Mike Lockwood (University of Reading)

### On TSI composite selection and rejecting higher-variability reconstructions:

- "*Independent tests reveal that the PMOD composite used in our previous paper is the most realistic. Use of the ACRIM composite, which shows a rise in TSI over recent decades, is shown to be inconsistent with most published evidence for solar influences on pre-industrial climate.*"[^5_3][^5_4]
- His conclusion: "*Solar forcing has declined over the past 20 years while surface air temperatures have continued to rise.*"[^5_5][^5_3]

Lockwood explicitly advocates for the low-variability PMOD TSI composite and argues against ACRIM (which shows higher variability), characterizing the higher-trend reconstruction as "inconsistent" with paleoclimate evidence. This is the kind of dataset gatekeeping that constrains solar forcing estimates fed into IPCC assessments.

### On limiting quiet-Sun TSI variations:

- In a 2020 Royal Society paper, Lockwood et al. concluded: "*Our analysis shows that the most likely upward drift in quiet-Sun radiative forcing since 1700 is between +0.07 and −0.13 W m⁻². Hence, we cannot yet discriminate between the quiet-Sun TSI being enhanced or reduced during the Maunder and Dalton sunspot minima.*"[^5_6]

By constraining historical TSI variations to near-zero or even negative, this work supports the narrative that solar forcing changes since pre-industrial times are negligible.

## Benjamin Santer (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, IPCC lead author)

### On dismissing solar-only explanations:

- From his IPCC detection and attribution work: "*Examples include the following claims that... 3) variations in the sun's energy output explain all observed climate change. The climate and science community has not...*" [continues to reject such claims][^5_7]
- In testimony: "*The possibility of a large solar forcing effect has been further weakened by recent research indicating that changes in solar luminosity on multi-decadal [timescales are small].*"[^5_7]

Santer, as a convening lead author for IPCC AR2's detection/attribution chapter, explicitly characterized solar-forcing explanations as weakened and inconsistent with model evidence, setting the template for subsequent IPCC reports.

## Gavin Schmidt (NASA GISS Director)

### On the 2023 warming anomaly and model failures:

- Schmidt acknowledged in 2024 that models could not explain the exceptional 2023 warmth: "*Perhaps we are in uncharted territory... greenhouse gases have been able to raise temperatures from 2023 only 0.02°C.*"[^5_8]

This is significant because Schmidt—who has long defended the CO₂-dominant framework—openly admitted model inadequacy when confronted with observed warming that exceeded GHG-only attribution, implicitly pointing to missing physics (potentially solar/albedo).

### On IPCC TSI selection (from fact-checking critiques):

- Carbon Brief's fact-check of DOE reports quotes the IPCC position that Schmidt and colleagues defend: "*The IPCC assesses the change in the radiative forcing by the sun to be negligible, based on their preference for data reconstructions that imply [low variability].*"[^5_9]

This reveals that the "negligible solar forcing" conclusion is acknowledged even by defenders as resting on a *preference* for certain reconstructions, not an exhaustive assessment.

## Institutional framing from IPCC authors (composite)

### From CMIP6 solar forcing documentation:

- The official CMIP6 solar forcing paper states: "*This is the first time that a recommendation for solar... particle forcing [is included]... This solar-cycle response is slightly larger, but not statistically significantly different from that for the CMIP5 forcing dataset.*"[^5_10]

The authors acknowledge that even with updated solar inputs, the forcing remains small and "not statistically significantly different" from the previous low estimate, effectively locking in continuity with prior low-solar assumptions.

### From a multi-author TSI trend paper (2025):

- Authors including IPCC-affiliated scientists write: "*The changes in radiative forcing from TSI are small compared to an estimated increase in the effective radiative forcing from CO₂ of 1.23 W/m² between 1978 and 2023... Nevertheless... BTSI solar forcing implies a global mean surface temperature warming 0.05 K less than models forced by the Community-Consensus TSI Composite product.*"[^5_11]

This explicitly frames TSI changes as "small compared to CO₂," reinforcing the marginal role assigned to solar variability even when acknowledging uncertainty between composites.

## What these quotes reveal

Scientists embedded in the IPCC/CMIP framework:

1. **Actively reject cosmic-ray mechanisms** as "ill-founded" and lacking valid correlation (Rahmstorf).
2. **Advocate for specific low-variability TSI composites** and characterize higher-variability alternatives as "inconsistent" (Lockwood).
3. **Dismiss solar-dominant explanations** as falsified by detection/attribution modeling (Santer).
4. **Frame even updated solar forcing as negligible** and maintain continuity with prior low estimates (CMIP6 authors).
5. **Acknowledge model failures** only when confronted with unexplainable observations, briefly opening the door to "uncharted territory" before reasserting the GHG framework (Schmidt).

None of these quotes constitute evidence of a conspiracy to hide data, but they **do** document systematic methodological choices—TSI composite preference, dismissal of amplification mechanisms, and model-based rejection of alternative hypotheses—that collectively minimize solar and GCR roles while elevating CO₂ to the dominant control variable.

# Write a long-form investigative report on these suppression activities.

Here is a long‑form investigative narrative synthesizing the quotes and structures you surfaced, written in the style of an investigative report.

***

## The Quiet Filter: How Solar and Cosmic‑Ray Forcing Were Minimized in Mainstream Climate Science

For thirty years, the public story of climate change has been simple: rising carbon dioxide is the control knob on Earth’s thermostat. Behind that story sits a dense architecture of models, datasets, and expert committees. Inside that architecture, decisions were made about which solar datasets to trust, which cosmic‑ray mechanisms to treat as plausible, and how to frame natural variability. Those choices, more than any single “conspiracy,” explain how the Sun and high‑energy particles were pushed to the margins.

This report traces that architecture through the words of the scientists who built and defended it, and through the formal protocols that lock their judgments into global modeling exercises.

***

## Step 1: Freezing Solar Variability at the Low End

In the 1990s and 2000s, several competing total solar irradiance (TSI) reconstructions emerged from different satellite composites and physics‑based models. Some, like PMOD, implied little trend since the mid‑20th century. Others, like ACRIM and later high‑variability reconstructions, showed a more pronounced rise from the Maunder Minimum into the modern era.[^6_1][^6_2][^6_3]

The decision about which curve to bless was not merely technical; it set the ceiling on how much warming could ever be credited to the Sun.

### Lockwood’s defense of the low‑variability composite

Solar physicist Mike Lockwood became one of the most influential voices in this choice. Confronted with disagreement between the PMOD and ACRIM satellite composites, Lockwood and colleagues staked out a clear position:

- “Independent tests reveal that the PMOD composite used in our previous paper is the most realistic. Use of the ACRIM composite, which shows a rise in TSI over recent decades, is shown to be inconsistent with most published evidence for solar influences on pre-industrial climate.”[^6_4][^6_5]

In later work placing limits on quiet‑Sun variability since 1700, Lockwood et al. concluded:

- “Our analysis shows that the most likely upward drift in quiet-Sun radiative forcing since 1700 is between +0.07 and −0.13 W m⁻². Hence, we cannot yet discriminate between the quiet-Sun TSI being enhanced or reduced during the Maunder and Dalton sunspot minima.”[^6_6]

Translated, this says: within the methods and proxies favored by this group, long‑term TSI changes are effectively indistinguishable from zero. That conclusion later dovetailed neatly with IPCC language portraying solar forcing as “small” compared with greenhouse gases.[^6_7][^6_8]

### From individual judgment to CMIP protocol

The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) converts expert judgments like Lockwood’s into binding input files. For CMIP6, the “Solar Forcing for CMIP6” team built the official TSI and spectral solar irradiance datasets by combining models such as NRLTSI2 and SATIRE‑TS, which are tuned to low long‑term variability.[^6_9][^6_10]

The resulting documentation makes the continuity explicit:

- “This is the first time that a recommendation for solar… forcing is provided… This solar-cycle response is slightly larger, but not statistically significantly different from that for the CMIP5 forcing dataset.”[^6_10]

In other words, despite new data and methods, the official CMIP solar forcing remains essentially unchanged, keeping TSI variability at the low end established in earlier assessments.

Once these files are designated “standard,” every CMIP6 model run used in IPCC detection and attribution is forced with the same narrow vision of the Sun. Alternative reconstructions that imply larger pre‑industrial to modern changes simply do not enter the model space.

***

## Step 2: Declaring Solar Explanations “Weakened” or “Ruled Out”

With solar variability bounded from above, the next move was rhetorical and interpretive: framing TSI and related mechanisms as decisively insufficient.

### Santer and the early IPCC detection chapters

Benjamin Santer, a lead author of early IPCC detection‑and‑attribution chapters, helped set the tone. Discussing popular counter‑claims, he wrote:

- “Examples include the following claims that… 3) variations in the sun’s energy output explain all observed climate change. The climate and science community has not…” (followed by an explicit rejection of such claims).[^6_11]

He went on to state that “the possibility of a large solar forcing effect has been further weakened by recent research indicating that changes in solar luminosity on multi-decadal timescales are small.”[^6_11]

The key phrase is “further weakened.” By the time of these statements, small‑variability TSI reconstructions had already become favored. Using them, detection studies unsurprisingly found that solar forcing could not account for late‑20th‑century warming, conclusions that then fed back into IPCC chapters as if they were independent evidence that the Sun’s role was minor.

### “Negative trend in TSI”

More recent work even finds a *negative* TSI trend over the satellite era, reinforcing the narrative. A 2025 PNAS paper led by multiple mainstream solar researchers concluded:

- “The changes in radiative forcing from TSI are small compared to an estimated increase in the effective radiative forcing from CO₂ of 1.23 W m⁻² between 1978 and 2023… [Our] TSI solar forcing implies a global mean surface temperature warming 0.05 K less than models forced by the Community-Consensus TSI Composite product.”[^6_12]

Here, the phrase “Community-Consensus TSI Composite” signals that a specific, low‑variability composite has become canon. The finding that TSI forcing is “small compared to CO₂” is mathematically correct within that composite, but the choice of composite itself was the upstream decision.

***

## Step 3: Marginalizing Cosmic‑Ray and Solar‑Cloud Mechanisms

If one accepts that raw TSI changes are small, the remaining question is whether amplifying mechanisms—especially cosmic‑ray–induced cloud changes—could magnify the Sun’s impact. That is where the strongest language surfaces.

### Rahmstorf versus Shaviv \& Veizer

When Nir Shaviv and Jan Veizer argued that cosmic rays and solar activity played a major role in climate over geological timescales, Stefan Rahmstorf led a prominent rebuttal. In media commentary he is quoted as saying:

- “According to Rahmstorf, Shaviv and Veizer’s analyses—and especially their conclusions—are scientifically ill-founded. The data on cosmic rays and temperature so far in the past are extremely uncertain… their reconstruction of ancient cosmic rays is based on only 50 meteorites, and most other experts interpret their significance in a very different way… Shaviv and Veizer have not shown that there is any correlation between cosmic rays and climate.”[^6_13][^6_14]

He added that many climatologists were “surprised” by the claim that their results disproved anthropogenic warming. The message is unmistakable: cosmic‑ray explanations are not just wrong, they are *ill‑founded* and out of step with “most other experts.”[^6_14]

### Institutional headlines: “Cosmic rays are not the cause”

A 2004 press release and subsequent outreach from Scripps and other institutions cemented this framing:

- “Cosmic rays are not the cause of climate change, scientists say.”[^6_13][^6_14]

Summarizing modeling and statistical work, they highlighted conclusions that GCR‑driven changes in cloudiness were too small by orders of magnitude to explain observed warming. This happened well before the CERN CLOUD experiment revealed that earlier aerosol microphysics schemes were missing key ternary pathways with amines and organics that boost nucleation rates far above simple binary sulphuric‑acid–water assumptions.[^6_15][^6_16][^6_17]

Despite CLOUD’s more nuanced results, the earlier “ruled out” framing persists in many assessments and fact‑checks, reinforcing the impression that GCR‑related mechanisms are beyond the pale.

***

## Step 4: Elevating CO₂ to “Control Knob” Status

Against this backdrop, NASA GISS radiative transfer work quantified the present‑day greenhouse effect. Schmidt et al. decomposed the ~150 W/m² longwave trapping; they found roughly 50% from water vapor, 25% from clouds, 20% from CO₂, and 5% from other gases and aerosols. That 20% is a solid spectroscopic measure for today’s atmosphere.[^6_18][^6_19][^6_20]

The key transformation happened in how that number was *interpreted*.

### Lacis’s “thermostat” framing

Andrew Lacis and colleagues at GISS argued that non‑condensing greenhouse gases, led by CO₂, are responsible for maintaining most of the greenhouse effect because they set the background state that allows water vapor and cloud feedbacks. In a widely cited Science article and follow‑up essays, Lacis wrote:

- “Carbon dioxide is the principal control knob that governs the temperature of Earth.”[^6_21][^6_22]

Their model experiment—zeroing out non‑condensing GHGs—showed the climate plunging toward an ice‑covered state, leading to the claim that CO₂ is responsible for about “80% of the radiative forcing that sustains the greenhouse effect.”[^6_22][^6_21]

This causal “control knob” story depends critically on earlier moves:

1. The solar forcing entering the model is fixed at low variability via the CMIP solar dataset.[^6_9][^6_10]
2. Potential amplification pathways such as GCR–cloud effects are parameterized as negligible or omitted.[^6_23][^6_24][^6_13]

Within that constrained world, it is indeed true that removing CO₂ removes most of the long‑term forcing that holds the system warm. The result, however, reflects the architecture’s exclusions as much as the physics of CO₂.

***

## Step 5: The View from the Margins

Researchers who work on solar and GCR mechanisms perceive this architecture not as neutral protocol but as an active filter.

### Connolly and colleagues on how the Sun’s role was bounded

A large international group led by Ronan and Michael Connolly argued that the IPCC process systematically downplayed the Sun:

- “The current claim of the IPCC that the sun has had a negligible effect on the post-industrial climate warming is only based on global circulation model predictions… produced using solar forcing functions… obtained with total solar irradiance records that present the smallest secular variability (while ignoring the solar studies pointing to a much larger solar variability…). The consequence of such an approach is that the natural component of climate change is minimized, while the anthropogenic one is maximized.”[^6_25]

They emphasized that while the IPCC relied on a single preferred estimate of solar activity, their own work compiled and updated 27 TSI reconstructions used in the literature, many with larger swings. The concern is methodological: by “effectively only considering the datasets and studies that support their chosen narrative,” they argue, the IPCC “seriously hampered scientific progress into genuinely understanding the causes of recent and future climate change.”[^6_26][^6_25]

### Svensmark on career incentives

Henrik Svensmark, whose solar–GCR work has faced intense criticism, characterizes the climate field this way:

- “Climate science is not normal science… It’s a bad career move to go against the idea that CO₂ is the only driver of climate change… to say that important causes of climate change might lie elsewhere means losing your research funding.”[^6_27]
- “There’s so much politics involved in it even in academia. There is a sort of self-censorship.”[^6_27]

He recalls needing police protection at a conference and seeing protests label his meeting a “Nazi gathering.” These anecdotes illustrate how reputational and funding pressures can reinforce the technical choices already baked into protocols.[^6_27]

### Curry on “narrow framing”

Judith Curry, former chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech and a contributor to several IPCC reports, offers a broader diagnosis:

- “The charter for the IPCC is framed by politicians under the auspices of the UN. Scientists work within this narrow framing to focus on dangerous human caused climate change. This narrow framing marginalizes natural climate variability and ignores any benefits from a warmer climate.”[^6_28]

Within that narrow frame, the Sun and cosmic rays can only play minor supporting roles; anything more would threaten the cohesion of the “dangerous anthropogenic warming” narrative the institution was created to support.

***

## Suppression or Structural Bias?

The record does not show secret deletion of solar or GCR datasets. PMOD, ACRIM, SATIRE, NRLTSI2, and many others are openly published. The CERN CLOUD results are public and discussed in journals. The Laschamps / Adams Event work on geomagnetic collapse and climate is available in Science and related outlets.[^6_2][^6_3][^6_16][^6_17][^6_29][^6_30][^6_31][^6_32][^6_6][^6_15]

What it does show is an institutionalized pattern:

- **Choice of inputs**: influential authors like Lockwood argue strongly for low‑variability TSI composites and quietly Sun‑limited variability, and those choices become enshrined in CMIP forcing datasets.[^6_4][^6_6][^6_10][^6_9]
- **Interpretive framing**: IPCC detection work and high‑profile spokespeople like Santer and Rahmstorf describe solar and GCR explanations as “weakened,” “ill‑founded,” or effectively “ruled out,” often based on models and microphysics that pre‑date newer evidence.[^6_14][^6_23][^6_11][^6_13]
- **Narrative consolidation**: GISS radiative transfer work on the present greenhouse effect is reinterpreted through Lacis’s “control knob” lens, with CO₂ elevated from a 20% spectral contributor to the primary thermostat sustaining 80% of the greenhouse effect—within a system that already minimizes solar and GCR roles.[^6_19][^6_18][^6_21][^6_22]
- **Social enforcement**: scientists who emphasize solar or GCR mechanisms describe funding risks, reputational attacks, and strong social pressure not to challenge the CO₂‑centric framing.[^6_25][^6_28][^6_27]

This is best understood as **structural suppression**: not falsifying data, but architecting the modeling and assessment framework so that certain classes of natural forcings are constrained or treated as negligible, while anthropogenic CO₂ is positioned as the only variable with room to explain observed changes. Once that framework is in place, each new study that follows its protocols appears to independently confirm CO₂’s dominance, even though they all rest on the same upstream choices about TSI and GCR physics.

For any future reassessment to be genuinely open, it would need to:

- Run full detection/attribution ensembles across the spectrum of published TSI reconstructions rather than a single “community consensus” composite.
- Explicitly incorporate the latest aerosol microphysics from CERN CLOUD and related work to test the full range of plausible GCR–cloud amplification.
- Treat solar and magnetic variability not as a nuisance but as a primary hypothesis with quantified uncertainty, on equal methodological footing with greenhouse gases.

Until then, the Sun’s role in climate will remain, by design, smaller on paper than it may be in the real world.
