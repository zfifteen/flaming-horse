SCRIPT = {
    "intro": """The last 60 years of unprecedented solar activity may not result from the strongest planetary forcing, but from the highest frequency of forcing reversals relative to the Sun's internal adjustment time, creating a cumulative perturbation regime that prevents the solar dynamo from returning to equilibrium between kicks.""",
    "standard": """Standard theories focus on whether planetary tidal forces are strong enough to perturb the Sun, or whether forcing frequencies match solar oscillation modes. Both miss a critical dynamic: when the rate at which forcing changes sign exceeds the rate at which the Sun's meridional flows can reorganize, perturbations accumulate instead of canceling.""",
    "ratio": """The key ratio is not how strong the forcing is, but how many times it reverses direction per solar convective overturn cycle. Think of it like repeatedly changing the direction you stir a pot before the liquid settles—even gentle stirring creates more mixing than strong but steady motion.""",
    "period": """Between 1960 and 2020, the dL/dt waveform crossed zero roughly six times in a 60-year window while the Sun's pole-to-pole meridional flow needs about 22 years to complete one cycle. This puts the ratio near 2:1—crossing twice per flow cycle—right at the threshold where cumulative effects should emerge. Prior epochs may have had comparable or even larger dL/dt amplitudes, but with crossings spaced 30-40 years apart, allowing the solar interior to fully relax between perturbations. The uniqueness of 1960-2020 is the clustering of reversals, not their individual strength.""",
    "predictions": """This predicts that as we move into 2020-2040, with the crossing frequency dropping back toward historical norms (ratio approaching 1:1 or lower), solar activity should decline toward baseline levels even if forcing amplitudes remain substantial. Solar Cycle 25 and 26 become critical tests. It also suggests that the Cameron-Schüssler critique—that tidal forces are too weak—may be attacking the wrong parameter. Weakness doesn't matter if you're hitting the system at a rhythm that prevents dissipation. The mechanism is more like preventing a pendulum from damping than like pushing it to larger amplitude.""",
    "conclusion": """For natural gas forecasters relying on ENSO patterns: if planetary forcing genuinely drives these oscillations, the 2025-2035 period should show reduced coupling strength as we exit the high-crossing-frequency regime, meaning other drivers (volcanic, anthropogenic) will dominate more than in recent decades.""",
