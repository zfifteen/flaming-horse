    "intro": """Have you ever wondered what number, when multiplied by itself, gives you 16? Or what the side length of a square with area 25 should be? Welcome to the fascinating world of square roots, where we unlock the secrets behind these fundamental mathematical concepts that appear everywhere from basic geometry to advanced physics.""",
    "definition": """A square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, produces that original number. For example, the square root of 9 is 3, because 3 times 3 equals 9. We write this mathematically as the square root symbol over 9 equals 3. Every positive number has two square roots - a positive and a negative one - except zero, which has just one.""",
    "visualization": """Let's make this visual. Imagine a square with an area of 16 square units. To find its side length, we take the square root of 16, which gives us 4. So each side measures exactly 4 units. The square root tells us the side length needed to create a square with a given area. This geometric interpretation shows why square roots are so important in measurement and design.""",
    "calculation": """Calculating square roots depends on whether we're dealing with perfect squares or not. For perfect squares like 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36, we have exact roots: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively. But for numbers like 10 or 15, we need approximations. The square root of 10 is approximately 3.16, since 3.16 times 3.16 gives us about 10. Various methods exist for calculating these approximations, from simple guess-and-check to advanced algorithms.""",
    "applications": """Square roots aren't just abstract concepts - they have countless real-world applications. In physics, the distance formula involves square roots when calculating straight-line distances between points. Engineers use them for determining stresses in materials and loads on structures. In finance, they're crucial for volatility calculations and risk assessment. Even in computer graphics and game design, square roots help with collision detection and realistic movement.""",
    "recap": """To wrap up our exploration, remember that a square root is a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. We've learned how to calculate them for both perfect squares and approximations, visualized them geometrically, and discovered their importance across science, engineering, and technology. Square roots are truly one of mathematics' most powerful and practical tools.""",
