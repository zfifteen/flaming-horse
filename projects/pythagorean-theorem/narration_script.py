    "intro": """Have you ever wondered how carpenters make sure the corners they build are perfectly square? They use a simple trick called the 3-4-5 rule. If they measure 3 feet one way, 4 feet the other, and the diagonal measures exactly 5 feet, then the corner is perfectly square. This is actually the famous Pythagorean theorem in action, and today we're going to explore what it means and why it works.""",
    "theorem": """The Pythagorean theorem is one of the most important ideas in math. It says that in any right triangle - that's a triangle with one 90-degree angle - the square of the longest side, called the hypotenuse, equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In math notation, it's written as a squared plus b squared equals c squared, where c is always the hypotenuse.""",
    "proof": """Let's see a visual proof of why this theorem works. Take a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 units. If we draw squares on each side of the triangle, the area of the largest square on the hypotenuse should equal the combined areas of the two smaller squares. Three squared is 9, four squared is 16, which adds up to 25. And five squared is also 25. They match perfectly! This shows that the areas are equal, proving the theorem.""",
    "application": """The Pythagorean theorem isn't just for drawing squares. It has real-world uses too. Imagine a 10-foot ladder leaning against a wall, with its base 6 feet away from the wall. How high up the wall does the ladder reach? The ladder forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle, so we can use the theorem. Six squared plus the height squared equals ten squared. That means 36 plus h squared equals 100. Subtracting 36, h squared is 64, so the height is 8 feet.""",
    "conclusion": """The Pythagorean theorem works for any right triangle, not just the special 3-4-5 case. For example, take sides 5, 12, and 13. Five squared is 25, twelve squared is 144, total 169. Thirteen squared is also 169. It works every time! This powerful idea helps us solve problems in math, science, and even everyday life.""",
