    "intro": """Have you ever wondered why some numbers seem to go on forever without repeating, like pi or the square root of two? Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of irrational numbers. These are the numbers that can't be written as simple fractions, setting them apart from the rational numbers we're more familiar with. Let's explore what makes them special.""",
    
    "definition": """First, let's clarify what we mean by irrational numbers. A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers - that's a fraction like one-half, three-quarters, or even whole numbers like five over one. But irrational numbers are those that cannot be written as such a fraction. They have decimal expansions that neither terminate nor repeat in a predictable pattern.""",
    
    "examples": """Some of the most famous irrational numbers include pi, which we know starts as 3.1415926535 and continues infinitely without repeating. Then there's e, the base of natural logarithms, beginning with 2.7182818284. And we have square roots of numbers that aren't perfect squares, like the square root of two, which equals approximately 1.4142135623. These numbers appear everywhere in mathematics and science.""",
    
    "proof": """To really understand why the square root of two is irrational, let's look at a classic proof by contradiction. Suppose that the square root of two could be written as a fraction p over q, where p and q have no common factors. If we square both sides, we get 2 equals p squared over q squared, which means 2 q squared equals p squared. This tells us that p squared is even, so p must be even. Let p equal 2r, and we get 2 q squared equals 4 r squared, or q squared equals 2 r squared. This means q squared is even, so q is even too. But now both p and q are even, contradicting our assumption that they have no common factors. Therefore, the square root of two cannot be rational.""",
    
    "properties": """Irrational numbers have some remarkable properties. They're dense on the number line, meaning between any two rational numbers, you'll find infinitely many irrationals, and vice versa. They're uncountable, unlike the rational numbers which can be listed. In geometry, the diagonal of a unit square has length square root of two, an irrational number. And in real analysis, irrational numbers help us understand the completeness of the real number system.""",
    
    "conclusion": """Irrational numbers might seem mysterious at first, but they're fundamental to our understanding of mathematics. From the circles and logarithms to the very structure of the real numbers, they remind us that not everything can be neatly expressed as a fraction. These infinite decimals challenge our intuition and drive mathematical discovery forward."""
