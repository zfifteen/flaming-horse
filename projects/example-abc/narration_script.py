SCRIPT = {
    "intro": """Welcome to our exploration of hash functions. In computer science, hash functions play a crucial role in data security and efficiency. Let's dive in to understand what they are and why they matter.""",
    "definition": """A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input of any size and produces a fixed-size output, called a hash value or digest. It's like a digital fingerprint for data. No matter how large the input, the output is always the same length.""",
    "properties": """Hash functions have several important properties. They are deterministic, meaning the same input always produces the same hash. They are one-way, making it computationally infeasible to reverse the process. And they have avalanche effect, where small input changes cause big output changes.""",
    "examples": """Hash functions are used everywhere. They secure passwords by storing hashes instead of plain text. They ensure file integrity by comparing hashes. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use them in mining and transaction verification.""",
    "conclusion": """To recap, hash functions create unique digital fingerprints for data, enabling secure storage, integrity checks, and efficient data structures. They are fundamental to modern computing security.""",
