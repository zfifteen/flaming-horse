The technical machinery that makes this paper strategically problematic for mainstream attribution frameworks centers on how TPW directly modifies the latitudinal structure of insolation, which in turn reshapes the bifurcation diagram of stable climate states without any change in greenhouse gas forcing. [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)

## TPW as a primary climate forcing mechanism

TPW changes the rotation axis orientation relative to the surface geography, which alters the latitude–insolation mapping for fixed orbital elements (obliquity, eccentricity, precession).  For a given location on the surface, this appears as a shift in effective latitude \(\Delta \phi\) without any motion of the continent itself, modifying annual‑mean insolation as: [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147)

\[
Q(\phi) \rightarrow Q(\phi + \Delta \phi)
\]

where \(Q(\phi)\) is the latitude‑dependent top‑of‑atmosphere insolation.  For Neoproterozoic Earth‑analog simulations, the paper shows TPW tilts up to \(\Delta \phi \sim 50^\circ\) can more than double polar insolation, shifting the ice‑line latitude by \(\sim 10^\circ\) or more even at fixed CO₂. [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)

## Coupling to energy balance models and bifurcation structure

The authors use a latitude‑dependent energy balance model (EBM) where surface temperature \(T(\phi, t)\) evolves according to:

\[
C \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = Q(\phi)(1 - \alpha(\phi, T)) - \text{OLR}(T) + D \nabla^2 T
\]

with \(C\) the heat capacity, \(\alpha\) the albedo (including ice‑albedo feedback), OLR the outgoing longwave radiation parameterized as \(A + B T\), and \(D\) the meridional diffusion coefficient.  TPW enters by changing the functional form of \(Q(\phi)\) dynamically as the pole location changes, which modifies both the absorbed shortwave (through \(\alpha\)) and the steady‑state balance. [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)

The critical insight is that bifurcation thresholds (snowball entry, waterbelt stability, snowball exit) depend on the gradient structure of \(Q(\phi)\), not just global‑mean insolation \(\langle Q \rangle\).  A TPW event that moves high‑albedo continents toward the equator or low‑albedo ocean toward the poles changes the ice‑line position and stability even at constant \(\langle Q \rangle\) and CO₂. [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)

## Required greenhouse forcing as a function of TPW

The paper defines a top‑of‑atmosphere longwave forcing parameter \(\Delta \gamma_1\), which acts as a proxy for CO₂‑driven radiative forcing (modifying the \(A\) term in OLR).  For a given ice‑line latitude \(\phi_{\text{ice}}\), the required \(\Delta \gamma_1\) to sustain that state is: [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)

\[
\Delta \gamma_1(\phi_{\text{ice}}, \Delta \phi_{\text{TPW}})
\]

The paper shows this function is "profoundly" altered by TPW.  Specifically: [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)

- At \(\Delta \phi_{\text{TPW}} = 0\), the ice line at \(\phi_{\text{ice}} = 30^\circ\) might require \(\Delta \gamma_1 = -10 \, \text{W m}^{-2}\). [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)
- At \(\Delta \phi_{\text{TPW}} = 30^\circ\), the same \(\phi_{\text{ice}} = 30^\circ\) might require \(\Delta \gamma_1 = -5 \, \text{W m}^{-2}\), or conversely, the original \(\Delta \gamma_1 = -10 \, \text{W m}^{-2}\) would move the ice line to \(\phi_{\text{ice}} = 20^\circ\). [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)

This means paleoclimate CO₂ estimates that back out \(\Delta \gamma_1\) from ice‑line proxies while assuming \(\Delta \phi_{\text{TPW}} = 0\) will systematically mis‑infer the required CO₂ by factors that can be \(\sim 50\%\) or more. [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)

## TPW driving mechanisms and timescales

TPW is driven by changes in Earth's inertia tensor \(I_{ij}\), which are sourced by:

1. **Mantle convection**: Long‑wavelength density heterogeneities in the mantle (hot upwellings, cold slabs) create non‑hydrostatic geoid anomalies that perturb \(I_{ij}\). [agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024AV001515)
2. **Surface mass redistribution**: Growth and ablation of ice sheets (Neoproterozoic glaciations, Pleistocene ice ages) and sediment loading change the surface mass distribution, which feeds back into \(I_{ij}\). [linkinghub.elsevier](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012821X1630749X)
3. **Plate tectonics**: Continental assembly and dispersal change the geographic distribution of continental vs. oceanic lithosphere, with different densities and thermal structures. [agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GC007490)

The rotation axis reorients toward the maximum principal axis of \(I\) on a viscous relaxation timescale:

\[
\tau_{\text{TPW}} \sim \frac{\eta}{g \rho R}
\]

where \(\eta\) is lower mantle viscosity (\(\sim 10^{22}\) Pa·s), \(g\) is gravity, \(\rho\) is density, and \(R\) is Earth radius.  For Earth, \(\tau_{\text{TPW}} \sim 10^7\) years, so large TPW rotations (\(\sim 30^\circ\)) can occur on \(10\)–\(30\) Myr timescales, which is comparable to or faster than typical CO₂ drawdown from silicate weathering.

## Neoproterozoic case: Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations

For the Sturtian (\(\sim 717\) Ma) and Marinoan (\(\sim 635\) Ma) snowball events, paleomagnetic data suggest TPW rotations of \(\sim 50^\circ\) to \(\sim 60^\circ\) occurred during or immediately before the onset of global glaciation.  The paper's model framework shows that: [nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35609-3)

- A \(\sim 50^\circ\) TPW that moves Gondwana from mid‑latitudes toward the pole increases polar insolation deficit and triggers ice‑albedo runaway at CO₂ thresholds \(\sim 100\)–\(250\) ppm, compared to \(\sim 10\)–\(50\) ppm if no TPW occurs. [cp.copernicus](https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/19/2203/2023/cp-19-2203-2023.html)
- The bifurcation structure shifts such that the "waterbelt" equilibrium (tropical ocean, polar ice, ice‑free mid‑latitudes) becomes unstable at much higher CO₂ than previously calculated, because the TPW‑modified insolation geometry destabilizes the mid‑latitude ice margin. [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)

## Ordovician–Silurian case: rapid TPW and mass extinction

The Ordovician–Silurian transition (\(\sim 450\)–\(440\) Ma) features a \(\sim 50^\circ\) TPW rotation at speeds up to \(55\) cm/yr (\(\sim 1^\circ\) per \(2\) Myr), which swept Gondwana across the South Pole.  This TPW event: [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9792554/)

- Directly explains the timing and geographic migration of glacial centers across Gondwana, which moved from North Africa to South America to Antarctica as the rotation axis reoriented. [nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35609-3)
- Caused abrupt, large changes in effective latitude for all continents, inducing both extinction (continents moving poleward into ice zones) and origination (continents moving equatorward into habitable tropics) simultaneously, which matches the paradoxical paleontological record. [nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35609-3)

The TPW‑driven latitude change \(\Delta \phi \sim 20^\circ\)–\(30^\circ\) over \(\sim 10\) Myr corresponds to a climate forcing rate comparable to or faster than anthropogenic warming (\(\sim 1\) W m\(^{-2}\) per decade regionally), but sourced entirely from geophysical dynamics rather than greenhouse gases. [nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35609-3)

## Jurassic East Asian aridification: TPW as a geographic climate driver

Between \(\sim 174\) Ma and \(\sim 157\) Ma, a \(\sim 25^\circ\) southward TPW rotation moved the East Asian blocks from the humid Northern Hemisphere temperate belt into the subtropical arid zone, triggering the "Great Jurassic East Asian Aridification" over \(> 10^7\) km² without any change in global mean temperature or CO₂.  This demonstrates that TPW can reorganize regional climate zones through insolation geometry alone, independent of global radiative forcing. [pubs.geoscienceworld](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/47/12/1112/574375/A-true-polar-wander-trigger-for-the-Great-Jurassic)

## Implications for paleoclimate CO₂ reconstructions

Standard paleoclimate CO₂ proxies (boron isotopes, paleosols, stomatal index) are calibrated assuming that ice‑line positions, sea‑surface temperatures, and continental weathering rates are uniquely determined by global mean temperature \(\langle T \rangle\) and CO₂.  However, if TPW is active: [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)

\[
\phi_{\text{ice}} = f(\langle T \rangle, \text{CO}_2, \Delta \phi_{\text{TPW}}, \text{continental config})
\]

Inverting this to estimate CO₂ from \(\phi_{\text{ice}}\) while assuming \(\Delta \phi_{\text{TPW}} = 0\) introduces systematic error.  For Neoproterozoic reconstructions, the paper shows this error can be factors of \(2\)–\(5\) in inferred CO₂ threshold for snowball entry. [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)

## Why this is strategically dangerous for AGW‑centric frameworks

The paper establishes that:

1. **Insolation geometry is a first‑order climate forcing**: Changes in \(Q(\phi)\) from TPW can drive global climate transitions (snowball entry/exit, mass extinctions, aridification) at rates and magnitudes comparable to greenhouse forcing, but through a completely orthogonal mechanism. [pubs.geoscienceworld](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/47/12/1112/574375/A-true-polar-wander-trigger-for-the-Great-Jurassic)
2. **Paleoclimate constraints on climate sensitivity are TPW‑dependent**: If you infer equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) from paleoclimate data by assuming all temperature/ice‑line changes are CO₂‑driven, you will overestimate ECS if TPW was active. [iopscience.iop](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3147/meta)
3. **Present‑day TPW is slow but not zero**: Geodetic data show ongoing TPW at \(\sim 0.1^\circ\) per Myr toward Hudson Bay, driven by post‑glacial rebound and mantle convection.  The framework implies this contributes a small but non‑zero forcing to high‑latitude insolation budgets, which is not included in IPCC models. [agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024AV001515)

This does not "disprove AGW," but it does severely weaken the argument that "climate sensitivity is well‑constrained by paleoclimate data" and opens a large wedge for questioning how much of observed 20th/21st‑century warming is attributable to CO₂ vs. other dynamical forcings (solar variability, magnetic field changes, internal ocean/atmospheric modes) that the IPCC framework treats as second‑order.
